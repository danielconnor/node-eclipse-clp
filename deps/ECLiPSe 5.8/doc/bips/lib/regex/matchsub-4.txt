matchsub(+Pattern, +String, +Options, -SubMatches)

   A substring of String matches the regular expression Pattern and SubMatches are matching sub-expressions

Arguments
   Pattern             A string (or a compiled pattern handle)
   String              A string
   Options             List of atoms
   SubMatches          Output: List of strings

Type
   library(regex)

Description

	Succeeds if all or a substring of String matches the regular
	expression Pattern. For the description of regular expressions
	see the library(regex) page.
	
    	Options is a (possibly empty) list of atomic option names,
	as described in the library(regex) page.
	
	SubMatches is bound to a list of strings, each corresponding to
	a parenthesized subexpression in Pattern. These subexpressions
	are ordered according to the position of their opening parenthesis
	within the pattern. The matching string appears on the corresponding
	position in the SubMatches list. Note that, if a subexpression matches
	several times, only the last match is returned.
	
    

Fail Conditions
   String does not match Pattern

Examples
   
    ?- matchsub("Name:([^,]+), Age:([0-9]+),", "Name:Fred, Age:34,", [], L).
    L = ["Fred", "34"]
    Yes
