matchall(+Pattern, +String, +Options, -AllMatches)

   AllMatches is a list of substrings of String which match the regular expression Pattern

Arguments
   Pattern             A string (or a compiled pattern handle)
   String              A string
   Options             List of atoms
   AllMatches          Output: List of strings

Type
   library(regex)

Description

	This predicates always succeeds.
	
    	Options is a (possibly empty) list of atomic option names,
	as described in the library(regex) page.
	
	AllMatches is bound to a list of strings. If the input string String
	does not match the pattern, the list is empty. Otherwise the list
	contains substrings of String which match the entire pattern,
	ordered according to their occurrence within String. No overlapping
	matches are returned, i.e. the next match is found by examining the
	remainder of String after the previous match.
	
	Note that this predicate does not return any information about
	matching (parenthesised) sub-expressions!
