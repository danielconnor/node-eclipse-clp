Description

This command adds an edge between two nodes in the graph.  The edge is
from Node1 to Node2.  Both nodes must exist in the final graph, but do
not need to be defined before the edge is entered.  Each edge must
have a unique name, typically a number or an atom.  Names for nodes
and edges do not have to be disjoint.
