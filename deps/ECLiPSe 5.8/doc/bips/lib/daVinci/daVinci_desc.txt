lib(daVinci)


This library provides a simple interface to the daVinci graph drawing
tool.  It allows to specify a graph with nodes, edges and their
attributes, and draws the graph inside the daVinci tool.  The
interface does not allow callbacks back from the daVinci system, nor
does it handle the customisation of the daVinci interface that is
possible. The daVinci system is a graph drawing tool developed at
the University of Bremen in Germany and is freely available for
non-profit and internal use.  Please download the software from their
WEB site daVinci
Home page and register with the developers.  We do not provide the
executable as part of this library. The communication between
Eclipse and daVinci is handled by a socket interface, where we
exchange text messages terminated by a line-feed.  In order to gain a
bit of flexibility in the interface, we use two string streams to
buffer information about edges and attributes.  The three streams used
for communication are called daVinciOut, daVinciEdge and
daVinciAttribute.  If the stream daVinciOut exists, we assume that the
daVinci server is running and that we can send information to it.  If
the stream does not exist, then we open the daVinci program in server
mode and connect the stream to the socket connection on the port
2542.
