sbds_try(+Var, ++Value)

   Try assigning a value to an SBDS search variable

Arguments
   Var                 The variable to use
   Value               The value to try

Type
   library(ic_gap_sbds)

Description
   Make an SBDS search choice.  Specifically, try assigning the (integer)
   value Value to the variable Var; on backtracking exclude the value Value
   from the domain of Var.

   Var should be an element of an array previously initialised using
   sbds_initialise/5.

   Use sbds_try/3 if you wish to know which is the currently successful
   branch (Var #= Value or Var #\= Value).
