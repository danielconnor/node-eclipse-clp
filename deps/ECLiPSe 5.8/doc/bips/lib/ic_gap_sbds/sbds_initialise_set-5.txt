sbds_initialise_set(+Array, ++VarDimNames, ++ValueDimSpec, +SymSpecs, +Options)

   Initialises the data structures required by the SBDS algorithm (set version)

Arguments
   Array               Array of integer set decision variables
   VarDimNames         Names for the dimensions of Array
   ValueDimSpec        Name of the value dimension and its range
   SymSpecs            List of symmetry specifiers
   Options             List of extra options

Type
   library(ic_gap_sbds)

Description
   Like sbds_initialise/5, but for set models (i.e. Array should be an array
   of integer set variables).  The "value" dimension is the values that can 
   appear in the set, so that, for example, a range of 1..5 indicates that
   the upper bound of the set variables is [1,2,3,4,5].

   See the documentation for sbds_initialise/5 for more details.

   During search, use sbds_try_set/3 or sbds_try_set/4 on variables from
   Array when making search decisions.
