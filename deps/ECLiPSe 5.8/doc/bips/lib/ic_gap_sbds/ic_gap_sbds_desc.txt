lib(ic_gap_sbds)

   This library provides a GAP-based Symmetry Breaking During Search (SBDS)
   library, as described in:

   Ian P. Gent, Warwick Harvey and Tom Kelsey.  "Groups and Constraints:
   Symmetry Breaking during Search.".  In P. Van Hentenryck, editor,
   Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Principles and
   Practice of Constraint Programming - CP 2002, LNCS 2470, pages
   415-430.  Springer-Verlag, 2002.

   It has been enhanced by (amongst other things) being integrated with the
   symmetry expression library described in:

   Warwick Harvey, Tom Kelsey and Karen Petrie.  "Symmetry Group Expression
   for CSPs."  In Barbara Smith et al., editors, Proceedings of
   SymCon'03: Third International Workshop on Symmetry in Constraint
   Satisfaction Problems, a workshop of CP 2003, pages 86-96.
   September, 2003.

   This library is still being developed and is expected to evolve.
   Feedback, suggestions, problem reports, etc. welcome.

   Please note that this library currently does not work on Windows machines
   due to its dependence on the GAP interface library.
