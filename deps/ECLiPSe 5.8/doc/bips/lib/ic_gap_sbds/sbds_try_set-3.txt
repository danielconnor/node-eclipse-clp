sbds_try_set(+Var, ++Value, ++Bool)

   Try adding/excluding a value to/from an SBDS set search variable

Arguments
   Var                 The set variable to use
   Value               The value to try
   Bool                Whether to add or exclude the value first

Type
   library(ic_gap_sbds)

Description
   Make an SBDS (set) search choice.  Specifically, if Bool is 1, try adding
   the (integer) value Value to the (set) variable Var; on backtracking
   exclude it.  If Bool is 0, try excluding Value first and try adding it on
   backtracking.

   Var should be an element of an array previously initialised using
   sbds_initialise_set/5.

   Use sbds_try_set/4 if you wish to know which is the currently successful
   branch (Value in Var or Value notin Var).
