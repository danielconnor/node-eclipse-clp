sbds_initialise(+Array, ++VarDimNames, ++ValueDimSpec, +SymSpecs, +Options)

   Initialises the data structures required by the SBDS algorithm

Arguments
   Array               Array of (integer) decision variables
   VarDimNames         Names for the dimensions of Array
   ValueDimSpec        Name of the value dimension and its range
   SymSpecs            List of symmetry specifiers
   Options             List of extra options

Type
   library(ic_gap_sbds)

Description
   Sets up the data structures required to perform an SBDS search.  Array is
   an array containing the (integer) search variables, SymSpecs defines the
   symmetries of the problem, with VarDimNames and ValueDimSpec providing
   some extra required information; these four arguments are the same as the
   first four arguments of construct_group/8: please see the documentation
   for that predicate for a complete description of these arguments and
   details of the supported symmetry specifiers.

   Options is a list of options which modify the way the search progresses.
   Currently no options are supported.

   During search, use sbds_try/2 or sbds_try/3 on variables from Array when
   making search decisions.
