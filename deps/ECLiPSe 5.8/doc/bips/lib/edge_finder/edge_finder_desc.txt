lib(edge_finder)

   
    This library implements the quadratic edge-finder algorithm for the
    disjunctive and cumulative scheduling constraints for the FD solver.
    It provides stronger propagation than the cumulative library, but
    weaker than the cubic edge_finder3 library for cumulative constraints.
    It is however computationally cheaper than the edge_finder3 library.

    Note that the same predicates are implemented in both edge_finder and
    edge_finder3 libraries.
