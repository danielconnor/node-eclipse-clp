disjunctive(+StartTimes, +Durations)

   Constrain the tasks with specified start times and durations to not overlap in time.

Arguments
   StartTimes          List of start times for tasks (fd variables or integers)
   Durations           List of duration for tasks (fd variables or integers)

Type
   library(edge_finder)

Description

    A disjunctive scheduling constraint. StartTimes and Durations are lists
    of equal length N of finite domain variable or integers.  The
    declarative meaning is that the N tasks with certain start times and
    duration do not overlap at any point in time.

    Any input variables which do not already have finite bounds will be
    given default bounds of -10000000 to 10000000.
