<H1>disjunctive(+StartTimes, +Durations)</H1>
Constrain the tasks with specified start times and durations to not overlap in time.

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
    A disjunctive scheduling constraint. StartTimes and Durations are lists
    of equal length N of finite domain variable or integers.  The
    declarative meaning is that the N tasks with certain start times and
    duration do not overlap at any point in time.
</P><P>
    Any input variables which do not already have finite bounds will be
    given default bounds of -10000000 to 10000000.
</P>
