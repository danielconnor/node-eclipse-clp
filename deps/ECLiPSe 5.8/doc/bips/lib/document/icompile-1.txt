Description

    Given an ECLiPSe source file (usually a file with a .ecl suffix), this
    tool generates an ECLiPSe interface information file (with .eci suffix).
    
    The given source file must contain a module definition. icompile then
    extracts all information about this module's interface (in particular
    all export directives), as well as the corresponding documentation
    (comment/2) directives, and writes those into an interface information
    file with .eci suffix. The latter can then be used to generate HTML
    documentation about the module.
