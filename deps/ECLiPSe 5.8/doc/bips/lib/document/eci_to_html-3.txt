Description

        This predicate processes one ECLiPSe interface information file
	EciFile (usually with .eci Extension) and generates .html
	files. The .html files are placed in a subdirectory in HtmlTopDir
	with the same name as EciFile but without the extension. This
	directory is created if it does not exist. The generated files are
	index.html, containing a summary description of the library, plus
	one file for each predicate that was commented using a comment/2
	directive in the source. The LinkBack argument should contain a
	hyperlink in HTML format. This will appear at the top of the
	generated pages and should usually point back to a parent page.
