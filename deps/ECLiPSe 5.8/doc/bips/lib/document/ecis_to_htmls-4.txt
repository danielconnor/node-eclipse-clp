	The generated files are:
	
	a toplevel index of all the processed directories
		(only if LibDirs has more than one element)
	for each directory an index of all the processed .eci files
	the documentation generated from each .eci file
	
	The LinkBack argument should contain a hyperlink in HTML format
	which will appear at the top of the toplevel index.  The
	SystemName argument will appear in several places and should
	be the name of the documented software system.
