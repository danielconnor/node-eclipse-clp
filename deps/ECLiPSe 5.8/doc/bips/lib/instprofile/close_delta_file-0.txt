close_delta_file

   Close the instrumentation profiler's delta results file.

Arguments

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   Close the file that the instrumentation profiler writes delta values to.
   The file must previously have been opened using open_delta_file/1. 
   
   Delta values are the instrumentation profiling results for the single
   execution (as opposed to aggregated) of a profiled code fragment.
   
   For performance reasons, the results are written to the file using 
   buffered I/O - each result is not flushed to the file as it is emitted. 
   As a result to ensure all results are flushed to the disk file,
   close_delta_file must be executed.
