statsample_control(+ProfileName, +State)

   Enable / disable the sampling profiler for a named profile.

Arguments
   ProfileName         Atom or string
   State               Atoms 'on' or 'off'

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   For the named profile, ProfileName, enable or disable the sampling
   profiler based on the value of State. Setting State to 'on' immediately
   enables sample collection at the inteval and to to the file specified in
   statsample/4.
   
   For performance reasons, the results are written to File (specified by
   statsample/4) using buffered I/O - each result is not flushed to disk as
   it is written. As a result to ensure all results are flushed to the file,
   statsample_control(ProfileName, off) must be executed before
   the results file can be analysed.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Profilename is not a valid profile defined by statsample/4.State is neither the atom 'on' nor the atom 'off'.
