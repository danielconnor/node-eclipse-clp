<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   The instprofile library provides two complimentary mechanisms for
   the profiling of ECLiPSe code with the metrics provided by the
   statistics/2 predicate:
   <OL>
   <LI>Instrumentation based, where metric measuring code is
   inserted directly into the user program in order to accurately
   determine how its constituent pieces of code perform. The
   mechanism for the insertion of instrumentation code is based upon 
   the facilities of the instrument library. As such, the statistic 
   measurements may be inserted at the beginning and end of clause or block 
   definitions, and around subgoals and/or predicate calls.  
   <LI>Sample driven, where metric measuring code is executed at a user
   defined interval as the user program runs. The sample based profiler is 
   implemented using after events and is therefore less intrusive in its
   effect on the performance of the executing code. 
   </OL>
   </P><P>
   While the performance overhead of the sampling profiler is lower, it 
   cannot be used to determine the exact cost of a piece of code for a 
   particular statistic. It merely provides snapshots with respect to time 
   not code location. The instrumentation based profiler does however
   provide the means for the measurement of both the aggregated cost for 
   all executions of a piece of code and also the cost for each individual 
   execution.
   </P><P>
   The usage of the instrumentation based profiler is as follows:
   <OL>
   <LI>Load the instprofile library
   <PRE>
   ?- lib(instprofile).
   </PRE>
   <LI>Compile your program with instrumentation profiling:
   <PRE>
   ?- instprofile:statprofile(my_program, [global_stack_used,
                              trail_stack_used]).
   </PRE>
   <LI>Run the query for which you wish to generate mode analysis data
   <PRE>
   ?- my_query(X,Y,Z).
   </PRE>
   <LI>Generate the results for the module into which the program
       was compiled.
   <PRE>
   ?- instprofile:result@my_program_module.
   </PRE>
   </OL>
   The usage of the sampling profiler is as follows:
   <OL>
   <LI>Load the instprofile library
   <PRE>
   ?- lib(instprofile).
   </PRE>
   <LI>Define a sampling profile
   <PRE>
   ?- instprofile:statsample(memory, 5, [global_stack_used,
                             trail_stack_used], 'memory_sample.dat').
   </PRE>
   <LI>Prior to running the queries for which you wish to gather 
   sampling data, enable the sampling profiler for the named profile
   <PRE>
   ?- instprofile:statsample_control(memory, on)
   </PRE>
   <LI>Run the query for which you wish to generate sampling data
   <PRE>
   ?- my_query(X,Y,Z).
   </PRE>
   <LI>Disable the sampling profiler for the named profile. The results
   file specified in statsample/4 contains the sampling data.    
   <PRE>
   ?- instprofile:statsample_control(memory, off)
   </PRE>
   </OL>
   </P><P>
   Limitations to be resolved shortly: 
   <OL>
   <LI><P>
   Results are currently produced per module, not for individual files
   within a module (i.e. results must be retrieved for all files within 
   a module).
   </P>
   <LI><P>When multiple statistics are specified, the order in which the
   statistics will appear in the results (pretty-printed source and results
   file) is displayed during the invocation of the statsample predicate,
   not the result predicate.
   </P>
   <LI><P>Results are produced to a file or annotated on pretty-printed
   source and these results to be viewed offline. Additional facilities 
   are to be provided that allow for the real time visualisation of results.
   </P>
   <LI><P>The model that accounts for the cost of inserted instrumentation is 
   fairly rudimentary (especially for the 'global_stack_used' statistic.
   </P>
   <LI>A future enhancement will enable the insertion of user defined metrics
   not just those available via statistics/2.
   </OL>
