open_delta_file(+DeltaFile)

   Open the instrumentation profiler's delta results file.

Arguments
   DeltaFile           Atom or string

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   Open the file that the instrumentation profiler writes delta values to.
   If a file has been previously opened using open_delta_file/1 it is shut
   before the specified file is opened. 
   
   Delta values are the instrumentation profiling results for the single
   execution (as opposed to aggregated) of a profiled code fragment.
   
   NOTE: Memory related statistics are displayed in bytes.
   
   For performance reasons, the results are written to the file using 
   buffered I/O - each result is not flushed to the file as it is emitted. 
   As a result to ensure all results are flushed to the disk file,
   close_delta_file must be executed.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   no

Exceptions
     4 --- File is not instantiated
     5 --- File is not an atom or string
