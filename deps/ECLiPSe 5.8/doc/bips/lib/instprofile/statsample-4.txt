statsample(+ProfileName, +SamplePeriod, +Statistics, +File)

   Create a statistics sampling profile.

Arguments
   ProfileName         Atom or string
   SamplePeriod        Number
   Statistics          List of statistic keywords
   File                Atom or string

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   The predicate defines a profile, ProfileName, for use by the sampling
   profiler. Samples of the statistics (statistics/2 metric keywords)
   specified in Statistics are collected every SamplePeriod seconds and 
   stored in File. The format of file is such that it can easily be
   analysed or graphed offline.
   
   The sample based profiler is implemented using after events and is
   therefore less intrusive in its effect on the performance of the 
   executing code than the instrumentation profiler. However, it is used to
   indicate the trend of resource usage over time of a running program not to
   attribute specific costs of a statistic to a specific piece of code. The
   instrumentation based profiler is used to do this.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Statistics is empty or contains an invalid statistic/2 keyword.

Exceptions
     5 --- File is not an atom or string

Examples
   
   [eclipse 1]: instprofile:statsample(memory, 5, [global_stack_used,
                                       trail_stack_used], 'memory_sample.dat').
   string     compiled traceable 476 bytes in 0.00 seconds
