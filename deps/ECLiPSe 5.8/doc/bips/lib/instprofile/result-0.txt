result

   Pretty-print the instrument profiled source with
   aggregated results.

Arguments

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   This will pretty-print all source files in the calling module context,
   annotated with the aggregated results of instrumentation profiling.  
   The resulting .html files are placed in a sub-directory called
   'instprofile', relative to the files that were compiled into the file.
   
   NOTE: Memory related statistics are displayed in kilobytes not bytes.
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has
   previously been compiled for instrumentation profiling using 
   instprofile:statprofile/2,3, and the code has been
   run in order to obtain profiling results.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the profiling results of a
   module other than the current calling module context can be obtained
   by invoking result@Module.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   The calling context module has not been profiled.
