aggregate_result(+File)

   Write the aggregated instrument profiling results to
   a named file.

Arguments
   File                Atom or string

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   This will write the aggregated results of instrumentation profiling 
   for all source files that have been compiled into the calling module 
   context and profiled with the instrument profiler.
   
   NOTE: Memory related statistics are displayed in kilobytes not bytes.
   
   This predicate should be executed before result/0 predicate, since
   result/0 also invokes reset/0 which resets the statistics.
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has
   previously been compiled for instrumentation profiling using 
   instprofile:statprofile/2,3, and the code has been
   run in order to obtain profiling results.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the profiling results of a
   module other than the current calling module context can be obtained
   by invoking aggregate_result@Module.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   The calling context module has not been profiled.

Exceptions
     4 --- File is not instantiated
     5 --- File is not an atom or string
