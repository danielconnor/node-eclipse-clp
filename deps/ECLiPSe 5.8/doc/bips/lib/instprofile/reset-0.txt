reset

   Reset the profiling statistics for the calling context
   module.

Arguments

Type
   library(instprofile)

Description
    
   This will reset the currently stored aggregated profiling results for 
   the calling context module.
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has
   previously been compiled for instrumentation profiling using 
   instprofile:statprofile/2,3, and the code has been
   run in order to obtain profiling results.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the profiling results of a
   module other than the current calling module context can be obtained
   by invoking reset@Module.
   

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   The calling context module has not been profiled.
