lib(sockets)


    Note that ECLiPSe provides its own built-in socket manipulation
    predicates which provides similar functionality to this library.
    
    This library is only provided for compatibility with the socket
    manipulation predicates of SICStus Prolog. To use these predicates,
    the sockets library has to be loaded: 
    
    :- use_module(library(sockets)).
    
    For SICStus 3.0, the sockets predicates are also in a sockets library,
    so no changes are needed to load the library.  However, for older
    versions of SICStus, the predicates are available as built-ins, and no
    library has to be loaded.  So if the code is written for older
    versions of SICStus, then the above line has to be added. 
    
    The sockets library can be used independently of the sicstus library.
