lib(gap)

   This library provides an interface to the GAP computational algebra
   system (see www.gap-system.org).  GAP must be installed and appear in the
   user's path in order for this library to work.

   Commands can be sent to GAP using the gap_command/2 predicate.  If there
   are results that need to be returned to ECLiPSe, use gap_query/3 or
   gap_query_string/3.  Normally GAP will be started automatically when it
   is needed, and shut down automatically when the ECLiPSe session ends, but
   some manual control is available through gap_ensure_started/0,
   gap_shutdown/0 and gap_restart/0.  gap_running/0 can be used to determine
   whether a GAP session is currently active.

   The current implementation of the library only supports one GAP session
   at a time, to be shared amongst all software components that use the
   library.  In future we expect to allow multiple concurrent independent
   sessions through the use of handles.

   This library supports the following options (see library(config_opts)):
   
   gap_reporting_level
       Controls how much reporting output the GAP interface generates.
       Valid levels are:
       
       silent
           Generate no reporting output under any circumstances.
       error
           Generate reporting output only when an error occurs.
       standard
           Generate basic reporting output.
       verbose
           Generate lots of reporting output, including all commands and
           queries sent to/from GAP.
       
       The default is standard.  Verbose can be useful for debugging.

   gap_reporting_stream
       Specifies the stream to send reporting output to.  By default,
       ECLiPSe's standard output stream is used.
   

   This library is still experimental and is expected to evolve.  Feedback,
   suggestions, problem reports, etc. welcome.

   Please note that this library currently does not work on Windows machines
   since it relies on named pipes, which are currently unsupported by
   cygwin.
