gap_shutdown

   Shut down a GAP session

Type
   library(gap)

Description
   Shuts down the currently active GAP session if there is one.  With recent
   versions of ECLiPSe it is not normally necessary to call this explicitly;
   GAP will be shut down automatically before the ECLiPSe session ends.
   However, there may be circumstances where one wishes to force GAP to shut
   down before the session ends, and on older versions of ECLiPSe a manual
   shutdown is required in order to terminate the GAP process and clean up
   the named pipes used for communication.
