gap_restart

   Restart a GAP session

Type
   library(gap)

Description
   Restarts the currently active GAP session.  This is useful if one wishes
   to discard GAP's current state and start again with a fresh session (all
   GAP state is lost).

   This predicate is simply a short-hand for calling gap_shutdown/0 and then
   gap_ensure_started/0.
