gap_ensure_started

   Make sure there is a GAP session active

Type
   library(gap)

Description
   Makes sure that there is a GAP session currently active, by starting GAP
   if required.  It is normally not necessary to call this predicate
   directly, since sending any GAP command or query will automatically start
   GAP if GAP is not currently running.  However, there may be circumstances
   where one wishes to force GAP to start, to avoid the start-up delay later
   when the first command is sent.
