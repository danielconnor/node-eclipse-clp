lib(iso)


    This library provides a reasonable degree of compatibility with
    the definition of Standard Prolog as defined in ISO/IEC 13211-1
    (Information Technology, Programming Languages, Prolog, Part 1: 
    General Core, 1995).  The areas where the library is not fully
    compiant are I/O and exception handling.  However it should be
    sufficient for most applications.  The library is provided in
    source form.
    
    The effect of the compatibility library is local to the module where
    it is loaded. For maximal ISO-compatibility, an ISO-program should
    be contained in a  separate module starting with a directive like
    
    :- module(myisomodule, [], iso).
    
    In this case, Eclipse-specific language constructs will not be available.
    
    If the compatibility package is loaded into a standard module, e.g. like
    
    :- module(mymixedmdule).
    :- use_module(library(iso)).
    
    then ISO and Eclipse language features can be used together. However,
    ambiguities must be resolved explicitly and confusion may arise from
    the different meaning of quotes in Eclipse vs ISO.
    
    The recommended way is therefore the former one, ie to put code written
    in different language dialects into different modules.
