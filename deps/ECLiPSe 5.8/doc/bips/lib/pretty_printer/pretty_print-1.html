Print a file in html format

<H2>Description</H2>

The system prints the contents of the file given as the argument as an
output file in html format.  This is one of the possible formats
supported by the pretty printer (see <b>pretty_print/2</b>).  The system
automatically adds the extension <i>.html</i> and places the result in a
subdirectory called 'pretty' relative to the source file.  Syntax coloring
is used to highlight different language features, and a uniform formatting
of the source code is used.
<p>
As the clauses are read with the normal Prolog read routine, comments
within clauses are lost, but comments and spacing between clauses is
preserved.
<p>
Hyperlinks are used for documented builtin predicates, as well as
predicates defined in the same file.  For a built-in, the hyperlink
will lead to the manual page of the predicate, for other predicates
the link points to the first definition of the predicate.  The
hyperlinks to the builtins are based on the installation directory of
Eclipse, so that the resulting output will normally not work on a
machine where eclipse is installed in a different directory.
<p>
If a list of several files is given, an additional index page index.html
with links to the individual pretty-printed source files will be generated.
<p>
The pretty printer does not check for undefined predicates or
predicates that are defined in included files.
<p>
The colours used are similar to those used by the EMACS Eclipse mode.
Colours are used more consistently than in the EMACS editor, as the
source text is parsed completely.
<p>
You can modify the colour scheme by modifying the style sheet
style.css which is located in the directory where the .html files get
generated (by default the subdirectory 'pretty').  The pretty-printer
will generate a default style sheet file if none exists, but not touch
any existing one.
