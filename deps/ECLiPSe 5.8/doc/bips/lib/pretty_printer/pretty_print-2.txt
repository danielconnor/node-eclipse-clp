pretty_print(++Files, ++Options)

   Print a file in one of different formats

Arguments
   Files               a filename (atom or string), or a list of filenames
   Options             A list of Name:Value pairs

Type
   library(pretty_printer)

Description

    The system prints the contents of the file given as the argument as an
    output file in different formats. See pretty_print/1 for the general
    description.

    This predicate allows the following options to modify the results:

    format (default:html)
	Possible values are 'html' or 'txt'.  The 'html' format
	produces html output with syntax coloring and navigation
	links.  The output file goes into a directory 'pretty' and has
	the suffix .html.  The 'txt' format produces pure text output. 
	The output file goes into a directory 'pretty' and has the
	suffix .txt.
    outdir (default:pretty)
    	The location of the generated files. This can be an absolute or
	a relative pathname (in Eclipse's generic pathname syntax, atom
	or string). If it is a relative pathname, it is interpreted as
	reative to the location of the input source file.
    style (default:pretty)
    	Possible values are 'pretty' or 'coverage'. Selects one of two
	predefined styles for html output. The latter is a less colourful
	form intended for code coverage output.
    inline_css (default:off)
    	Possible values are 'off' or 'on'. If 'on', the html output will
	use an inlined style sheet instead of an external one. This is
	provided for browsers that have problems with including style sheets.
    css_span (default:span)
    	Possible values are 'span' or 'font'. If 'font', the html output will
	not emit span tags. This is provided for browsers that do not yet
	support HTML 4.x.
    link_back (default:"")
    	A string in html format that gets inserted as a link to a parent
	page into the generated pretty-printed source index.html page.
