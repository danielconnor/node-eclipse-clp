lib(sym_expr)

   This library provides a convenient way to express the symmetries of a
   CSP, as described in:

   Warwick Harvey, Tom Kelsey and Karen Petrie.  "Symmetry Group Expression
   for CSPs."  In Barbara Smith et al., editors, Proceedings of
   SymCon'03: Third International Workshop on Symmetry in Constraint
   Satisfaction Problems, a workshop of CP 2003, pages 86-96.
   September, 2003.

   This is particularly useful for GAP-based symmetry-breaking libraries, as
   it will construct an appropriate group in GAP and provide predicates for
   mapping between CSP assignments and the points acted on by the GAP group.

   Please note that this library currently does not work on Windows machines
   due to its dependence on the GAP interface library.
