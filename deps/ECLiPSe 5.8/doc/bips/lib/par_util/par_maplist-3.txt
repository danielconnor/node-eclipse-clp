par_maplist(+Pred, +In, ?Out)

   Parallel version of maplist/3

Type
   library(par_util)

Description
Parallel version of maplist/3.  The semantics is not
    exactly the same as maplist/3:  It does not work backwards and it
    does not cope with aliasing between the In and the Out list, since
    it is implemented on top of findall/3.  There will only be a
    performance gain if the mapping predicate does enough computation
    to make the overhead pay off.
