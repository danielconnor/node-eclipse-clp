start_tty_vc(++VCName, ++InitialViewGranularity, ++ChangeCondition)

   Start a TTY visualisation client, specifying both the view granularity and the change condition.

Arguments
   VCName              An atom; the name of the TTY VC.
   InitialViewGranularityAn atom: 'coarse' or 'fine'
   ChangeCondition     A term of the form change_condition(<Module>, <AttributeStructName>, <SuspListName>)

Type
   library(tty_vc)

Description


	     This predicate starts a TTY visualisation client (VC), but allows the user to specify both the view granularity, as in start_tty_vc/2 and the change condition. The change condition specifies the suspension list to use for updates. The most obvious choice is the default in the other two predicates, constrained of suspend in the suspend module. If other suspension lists are used, the value of the element displayed in the output of the TTY VC may sometimes be out of date. Otherwise the predicate behaves exactly like start_tty_vc/2.

Resatisfiable
   no
