start_tty_vc(++VCName)

   Start a TTY visualisation client.

Arguments
   VCName              An atom; the name of the TTY VC.

Type
   library(tty_vc)

Description


	     This predicate starts a TTY visualisation client (VC). The change condition is constrained of suspend. The view granularity is fine. For more control over these options, use start_tty_vc/2 or start_tty_vc/3.  The TTY VC is a non-logical entity in the sense that backtracking over the start_tty_vc goal does not affect the existence of the TTY VC. 

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails when any other TTY VC exists. Only one TTY VC can exist at a time, although in general there can be multiple VCs.
