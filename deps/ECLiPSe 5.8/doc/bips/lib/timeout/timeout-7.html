<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
    Goal is executed for a maximum of TimeLimit seconds. If the goal is still
    executing after TimeLimit, time-out occurs, the execution of the goal is
    terminated (via exit_block/1) and TimeOutGoal is executed.  If the value
    of TimeLimit is 0 or 1.0Inf, no timeout is applied to the Goal.
<P>
    SolutionMode is one of all_solution or per_solution.  If Goal is
    resatisfiable, then, having found a solution, the per_solution
    option reapplies the full value of the originally specified
    TimeLimit to the resuming Goal.  The all_solution option resumes
    the Goal with the unelapsed portion of TimeLimit (i.e.  its
    remainder) as the expiry time, the expiry time therefore remains
    the same.
<P>
    Timer is the after-event handle assigned to this timeout goal. It
    may be used within Goal to force early expiry of the timeout using:
    event(Timer). 
<P>
    DueTime is the time at which TimeLimit expires and the TimeOutGoal is 
    posted. It is instantiated before Goal starts executing and may therefore 
    be used within Goal and TimeOutGoal. DueTime is undefined (and remains
    uninstantiated) if the per_solution SolutionMode is specified.
<P>
    On success, TimeRemaining is the time left until TimeLimit expiry,
    if Goal completes before then, on timeout, TimeRemaining is 0.0.
<P>
    The predicate is based on the after event timers, so TimeLimit is 
    measured in the timer currently used by after events. The current time
    used for the associated event timer can be retrieved using
    statistics(event_time, CurrentTime). The timeout predicate can be used 
    with other after events, and can be nested within itself (i.e. embedded
    within Goal or TimeOutGoal). Within Goal, the remaining time that the Goal
    has left to run before time-out can be computed using:
<PRE>
    RemainingTime is max(0.0, DueTime - statistics(event_time)).
</PRE>
    This may be useful for setting up sub-timeouts as a fraction of the
    total remaining time.

If Goal is resatisfiable.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>    % time-out from infinite loop
    ?- timeout((repeat,fail), 1.5, writeln(timed-out), 
            all_solution, Timer, Due, Remainder).
    timed - out
    Timer = 'EVENT'(16'ed920978)
    Due = Due
    Remainder = 0.0
    Yes (1.51s cpu)
