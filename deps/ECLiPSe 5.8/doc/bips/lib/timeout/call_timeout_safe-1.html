<H1>call_timeout_safe(+Goal)</H1>
Execute Goal, deferring the execution of an interrupting timeout predicate TimeOutGoal until Goal completes.
<DL>
<DT><EM>Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>Goal to execute
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
    Metacall Goal, ensuring that its execution is not interrupted and
    preemptively aborted by a timeout of the timeout/3 or timeout/7 predicate.
    If a timeout would have occurred during the execution of Goal, it is
    effectively deferred until Goal completes.
<P>
    The predicate can be used within a computation which is subject to timeouts,
    to ensure that subgoals which should be executed as an atomic sequence
    preserve this atomicity at the cost of delaying the execution
    of TimeOutGoal.
<P>
    In all other respects the semantics of call_timeout_safe/1 is the same
    as call/1.
    
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
If Goal is resatisfiable.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>    ?- timeout(call_timeout_safe((writeln('Goal started'), 
                               sleep(5), 
                               writeln('Goal completed'))),
            3, writeln('Timeout expired!')).
    Goal started
    Goal completed
    Timeout expired!
    Yes (0.01s cpu)
