<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
    Goal is executed as if called via call(Goal),
    but only for a maximum of TimeLimit seconds. If the goal is
    still executing after TimeLimit, time-out occurs, the execution of the
    goal is terminated (via exit_block/1) and TimeOutGoal is executed.  If
    the value of TimeLimit is 0 or 1.0Inf, no timeout is applied to the Goal.
<P>
    Note that, if Goal is nondeterministic, execution flow may leave the scope
    of timeout/3 on success and re-enter on failure. In this case, only time
    spent within Goal will be counted towards the TimeLimit.
<P>
    The predicate is based on the after event timers, so TimeLimit is 
    measured in the timer currently used by after events. The current time
    used for the associated event timer can be retrieved using
    statistics(event_time, CurrentTime). The timeout predicate can be used 
    with other after events, and can be nested within itself (i.e. embedded
    within Goal or TimeOutGoal).
<P>
    Note that timeout/3 can be defined in terms of timeout/7 as:
<PRE>
    timeout(Goal, TimeLimit, TimeOutGoal) :-
        timeout(Goal, TimeLimit, TimeOutGoal, all_solution, _, _, _).
</PRE>
    
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
If Goal is resatisfiable.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>    ?- timeout((repeat,fail), 1.5, writeln(timed-out)). % time-out from infinite loop
    timed - out
    Yes (1.51s cpu)
    </PRE>
