ColgenInstance:minimize(+SolveSubProblem, +Obj, -ObjVal)

   Minimizes the problem associated with the colgen instance ColgenInstance.

Arguments
   SolveSubProblem     Subproblem solution predicate
   Obj                 The objective function to minimize
   ObjVal              The optimal solution cost

Type
   library(colgen)

Description
  
  Minimize the partial linear expression Obj for the problem
  associated with the colgen instance ColgenInstance, using
  the user-defined predicate SolveSubProblem to provide
  profitable variables during solution. The optimal solution cost is
  unified with ObjVal.
  
  The first argument of the subproblem solution predicate must be a
  subproblem structure:
 
      sp_prob(master_pool, cutoff, cost, coeff_vars, aux, module)
 
  where and master_pool will be unified with the colgen
  instance ColgenInstance so that solutions can be posted to
  it from within the solution predicate, cutoff is a minimum
  acceptable value for the cost of subproblem solutions that will be
  updated before calling the predicate, cost is the variable
  occurring in the implicit sum term of obj (if any)
  representing the contribution of new subproblem solutions to the
  master problem solution cost, coeff_vars is a list of all
  subproblem variables occurring in the implicit sum terms of master
  problem constraints, and module is the module in which the
  solution predicate should be called.
