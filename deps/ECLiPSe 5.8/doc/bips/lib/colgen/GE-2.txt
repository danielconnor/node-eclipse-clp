ColgenInstance:(?X >= ?Y)

   Constrains X to be greater than or equal to Y.

Arguments
   X                   Partial linear expression
   Y                   Partial linear expression

Type
   library(colgen)

Description
	Logically: Constrains X to be greater than or equal to Y. X
	and Y are partial linear expressions. Partial linear
	expressions may contain terms of the form
	implicit_sum(+Var) in addition to any terms allowed
	within a standard linear expression. Variables occurring
	inside implicit_sum/1 terms are taken to be
	subproblem variables whose instantiation will correspond to
	the coefficient of a generated master problem variable in this
	constraint. Operationally, the constraint gets delayed until
	the external solver state for ColgenInstance is invoked.
