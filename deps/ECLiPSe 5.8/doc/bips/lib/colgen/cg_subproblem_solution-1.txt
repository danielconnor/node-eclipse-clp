ColgenInstance:cg_subproblem_solution(++Value)

   Posts new subproblem solution(s) to the colgen instance ColgenInstance.

Arguments
   Value               Subproblem solution (sp_sol structure) or list of subproblem solutions

Type
   library(colgen)

Description
  
  Post subproblem solution(s) corresponding to a column of coefficients
  for a new master problem variable to the colgen instance
  ColgenInstance. The argument must be a sp_sol
  structure or list of such structures:
 
      sp_sol(cost, coeff_vars, aux)
 
  where cost is the master problem cost function coefficient
  of the solution, coeff_vars is a list of Id-Val
  pairs corresponding to the subproblem variable solution values and
  identifier of the constraint in which it occurred as an implicit sum
  term for those subproblem variables with a non-zero solution
  value. aux should contain any problem specific information
  which is of interest that is not represented uniquely by the cost
  and objective coefficients.
