colgen_instance(++ColgenInstance)

   Initialises the colgen instance ColgenInstance.

Arguments
   ColgenInstance      Colgen instance name (atom)

Type
   library(colgen)

Description
  
  Initialises the colgen instance ColgenInstance. A colgen instance is an
  instance of the colgen solver, to which colgen partial linear arithmetic
  constraints can be posted, and to which an external LP solver can be
  associated and used to optimise the posted constraints with respect
  to some objective.
  
  If ColgenInstance is not an already existing colgen instance, a new colgen
  instance will be created and initialised. If it is an existing colgen
  instance, and it is not currently being used (having no outstanding posted
  constraints and no associated solver), it is effectively reinitialised.
  Otherwise, the predicate aborts with an error. Note that a colgen instance
  is a module, and each colgen instance can be associated with at most one
  solver at any time and vice versa.
