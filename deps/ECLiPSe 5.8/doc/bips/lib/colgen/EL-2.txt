ColgenInstance:(?X =< ?Y)

   Constrains X to be less than or equal to Y.

Arguments
   X                   Partial linear expression
   Y                   Partial linear expression

Type
   library(colgen)

Description
	Logically: Constrains X to be less than or equal to Y. X and
	Y are partial linear expressions. Partial linear expressions
	may contain terms of the form implicit_sum(+Var) in
	addition to any terms allowed within a standard linear
	expression. Variables occurring inside implicit_sum/1
	terms are taken to be subproblem variables whose instantiation
	will correspond to the coefficient of a generated master
	problem variable in this constraint. Operationally, the
	constraint gets delayed until the external solver state for
	ColgenInstance is invoked.
