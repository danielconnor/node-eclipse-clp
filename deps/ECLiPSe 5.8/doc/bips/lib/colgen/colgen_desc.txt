lib(colgen)



   This library lets you use hybrid column generation. Partial linear
   constraints are posted to a solver and further variables added to
   them during search as they become profitable. The generated
   variables will have a column of coefficients in the constraints of
   the colgen instance associated with them corresponding to
   particular instantiations of the variables of a subproblem. The
   predicate to find profitable subproblem variable instantiations is
   supplied by the user. When a user-defined branching predicate is
   provided the library can also be sued for hybrid branch-and-price.

   The library uses the eplex library to solve LP master
   problems, from which dual values are used to create cost functions
   for the user-defined subproblem. Solution of master and subproblems
   will iterate until no further subproblem solutions are posted to
   the colgen instance.
