ColgenInstance:var_get(+Var, ++What, -Value)

   Obtain information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A solver problem variable for the solver associated with ColgenInstance
   What                Specification for information wanted (atom)
   Value               Returned value of What

Type
   library(colgen)

Description

   Retrieve information about solver constraints and results related to a
   particular variable, for the colgen instance ColgenInstance.
   What can take one of the following values:

    mp_val
    Returns the floating-point solution for variable Var.

    cost
    Returns the master problem objective coefficient
    associated with the variable Var.

    coeffs
    Returns a list of Id-Val pairs representing the constraint
    identifiers and coefficient values for the master problem
    constraints in which the coefficient is non-zero associated
    with the variable Var.

    aux
    Returns the auxiliary information associated with the
    variable Var. The intended use is for subproblem information
    not represented in the master problem constraint coefficients.
