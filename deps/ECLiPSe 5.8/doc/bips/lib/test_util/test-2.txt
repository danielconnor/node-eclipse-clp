test(+File, +Option)

   Runs all the test patterns in File.

Type
   library(test_util)

Description
    Runs all the test patterns in File. Option is either 'call' (the default)
    or 'compile'.
    When 'call' is chosen, every test goal gets executed simply by metacall
    using call/1.
    When 'compile' is chosen, every test goal gets compiled into an auxiliary
    predicate (with all compile-time transformations applied), which in turn
    is then executed.
