   adds the new element at the front of the list

Type
   library(queues)

Description

    adds the new element at the front of the list.  Unlike join_queue,

 	jump_queue(1, OldQ, NewQ1),
 	jump_queue(2, OldQ, NewQ2)

    *does* work, though if you add things at the end of NewQ1 they
    will also show up in NewQ2.  Note that

 	jump_queue(1, OldQ, MidQ),
 	jump_queue(2, MidQ, NewQ)

    makes NewQ start 2, 1, ...
