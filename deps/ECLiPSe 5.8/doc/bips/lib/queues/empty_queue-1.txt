empty_queue(Queue)

   tests whether the queue is empty

Type
   library(queues)

Description

    tests whether the queue is empty.  If the back of a queue were
    guaranteed to be a variable, we could have

 	empty_queue(Front-Back) :- var(Front).

    but I don't see why you shouldn't be able to treat difference
    lists as queues if you want to.
