make_queue(Queue)

   creates a new empty queue

Type
   library(queues)

Description

    creates a new empty queue.  It will also match empty queues, but
    because Prolog doesn't do the occurs check, it will also match
    other queues, creating circular lists.  So this should ONLY be
    used to make new queues.
