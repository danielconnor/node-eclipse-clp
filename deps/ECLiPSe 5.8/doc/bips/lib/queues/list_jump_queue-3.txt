Description

    adds all the elements of List at the front of the queue.  There  are
    two  ways  we might do this.  We could add all the elements one at a
    time, so that they would appear at the beginning of the queue in the
    opposite order to the order they had in the list, or  we  could  add
    them in one lump, so that they have the same order in the  queue  as
    in  the  list.   As you can easily add the elements one at a time if
    that is what you want, I have chosen the latter.
