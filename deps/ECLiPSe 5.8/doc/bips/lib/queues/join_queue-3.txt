join_queue(Element, OldQueue, NewQueue)

   adds the new element at the end of the queue

Type
   library(queues)

Description

    adds the new element at the end of the queue.  The old queue is
    side-effected, so you *can't* do

 	join_queue(1, OldQ, NewQ1),
 	join_queue(2, OldQ, NewQ2).

    There isn't any easy way of doing that, sensible though it might
    be.  You *can* do

 	join_queue(1, OldQ, MidQ),
 	join_queue(2, MidQ, NewQ).
