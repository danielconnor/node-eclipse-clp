   a connection waiting for the remote development tools to be attached to.
   It will print the hostname and the port number that should be given to
   the development tools. The remote development tools should be started 
   and supplied with the hostname and port number. Once this is done, the
   development tools are ready to be used. Control is initially given back
   to ECLiPSe when the tools have been attached.
