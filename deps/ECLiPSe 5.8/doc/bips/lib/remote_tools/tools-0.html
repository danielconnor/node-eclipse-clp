<H1>tools</H1>
Transfer control from ECLiPSe to the development tools.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
	Transfer the `control' from ECLiPSe to the development tools,
	allowing the user to use the development tools GUI interactively.
	This predicate returns when control is returned to ECLiPSe.
<P>
        Note that some features of the development tools can be triggered
        without interacting directly with the GUI. For example, placing a
        spy-point on a predicate will cause the tracer tool to pop-up when
        the predicate is called.
