tools

   Transfer control from ECLiPSe to the development tools.

Type
   library(remote_tools)

Description

	Transfer the `control' from ECLiPSe to the development tools,
	allowing the user to use the development tools GUI interactively.
	This predicate returns when control is returned to ECLiPSe.

        Note that some features of the development tools can be triggered
        without interacting directly with the GUI. For example, placing a
        spy-point on a predicate will cause the tracer tool to pop-up when
        the predicate is called.


Resatisfiable
   no

Exceptions
     6 --- tools/0 called before development tools have been attached.
