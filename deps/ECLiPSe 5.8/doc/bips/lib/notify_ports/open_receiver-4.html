<H2>Description</H2>

    SendPos and SendStruct identify a send port.  This predicate
    creates a receive port listening to messages sent via the
    specified send port.  The new receive port will receive all
    messages that are sent via the send port after the receiver has
    been opened.  Messages that were sent before the receiver has been
    opened will not be received by this receiver.
    <P>
    The receiver will be installed in field ReceivePos of the structure
    ReceiveStruct.
