<H2>Description</H2>

    This predicate creates a receive port listening to messages sent
    via the specified send port.  The new receive port will receive
    all messages that are sent via the send port after the receiver
    has been opened.  Messages that were sent before the receiver has
    been opened will not be received by this receiver.
