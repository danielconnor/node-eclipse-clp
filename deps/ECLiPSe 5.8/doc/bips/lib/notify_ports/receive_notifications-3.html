<H2>Description</H2>

    This predicate retrieves all the messages that are currently
    available at the given receive port.  This means all messages that
    were sent via the associated send port but have not yet been
    retrieved from this receive port. The messages are listed in the
    order in which they were sent.
    <P>
    The Status argument indicates whether the associated sender is still
    open ('open') or has been closed ('closed'). If closed, no more
    messages will arrive on this receive port in the future.
