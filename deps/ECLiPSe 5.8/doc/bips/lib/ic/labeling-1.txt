labeling(+Vars)

   Instantiates all variables in a list to elements of their domains.

Arguments
   Vars                A list of integer IC variables or integers

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Simple predicate for instantiating a list of integer IC variables to
   elements of their domains.  (Integers are also allowed in the list; they
   are effectively ignored.)  The variables are instantiated in the order in
   which they appear in the list; the implementation is essentially:

        labeling([]).
        labeling([Var|Rest]) :-
            indomain(Var),
            labeling(Rest).



Resatisfiable
   Yes.
