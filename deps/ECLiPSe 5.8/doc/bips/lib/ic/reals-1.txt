reals(?Vars)

   Vars' domain is the real numbers.

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or number, or a list or submatrix of variables/numbers

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Constrain the domain of the variables to be the real numbers.  This is
   the default, so the declaration is optional.

   Note that the notion of real numbers is used here in the pure
   mathematical sense, where real numbers subsume the integers.  A variable
   of type real can therefore be instantated to either a floating point or
   an integer number (or a bounded real).  If the variables are already
   instantiated, this call checks that the variable is instantiated to a
   number.
