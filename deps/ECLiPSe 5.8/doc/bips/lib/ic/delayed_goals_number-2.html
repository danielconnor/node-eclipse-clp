<H2>Description</H2>
   N is the number of constraints and suspended goals currently attached to
   the IC attribute of the variable Var.  Note that this number may not
   correspond to the exact number of different constraints attached to Var,
   as goals in different suspension lists are counted separately, and a
   constraint may decompose into more than one suspension.  This predicate
   is often used when looking for the most or least constrained variable
   from a set of domain variables.  If Var is not a variable, N is bound to
   1.0Inf; otherwise if Var is not an IC variable, N is zero.
</P><P>
   Note that this predicate only counts goals attached to the IC attribute;
   if you want to count all goals attached to a variable, use the generic
   delayed_goals_number/2.
