get_domain_as_list(?Var, ?DomainList)

   List of all the elements in the IC domain of Var

Arguments
   Var                 An IC variable or a number
   DomainList          The domain of Var as a list of elements.

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   If Var is an integer IC variable, DomainList will be set to an ordered
   list containing each element in the domain of Var.  If Var is a number,
   then DomainList will be set to a singleton list containing the number.

   Currently, an out of range exception would be raised if Var is an IC 
   variable of type real.  This may change in the future.


Fail Conditions
   The initial value of DomainList fails to unify with the returned value.

Exceptions
     5 --- Var is neither an IC variable or number.
     6 --- Var is a IC variable of type real.
