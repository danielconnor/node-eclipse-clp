<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Returns the current threshold.  For non-integer variables, bounds are
   only changed if the absolute and relative changes of the bound exceed the
   threshold.  This means that constraints over real variables are only
   guaranteed to be consistent up to the current threshold (over and above
   any normal widening which occurs).</P><P>

   Limiting the amount of propagation is important for efficiency.  A higher
   threshold speeds up computations, but reduces precision and may in the
   extreme case prevent the system from being able to locate individual
   solutions.</P>
