get_domain_size(?Var, ?Size)

   Size is the number of integer elements in the IC domain for Var

Arguments
   Var                 An IC variable or a number
   Size                A variable (or integer)

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   If Var is an integer IC variable, Size will be set to the number of 
   integer values in the domain of Var.  If Var is a number, then Size 
   will be set to 1.

   Currently, an out of range exception would be raised if Var is an IC 
   variable of type real.  This may change in the future.


Fail Conditions
   The initial value of Size fails to unify with the returned value.

Exceptions
     5 --- Var is neither an IC variable or number.
     6 --- Var is a IC variable of type real.
