or(+ConX,+ConY,Bool)

   Bool is the reified truth of at least one of the constraints ConX or ConY being true.

Arguments
   ConX                Constraint
   ConY                Constraint
   Bool                Reified truth value of the constraint

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Equivalent to BX $= (ConX), BY $= (ConY), Bool #= (BX + BY #>= 1)
   
   The two constraints are reified in such a way that Bool reflects the
   truth of at least one being true.  ConX and ConY must be constraints that
   have a corresponding reified form.
