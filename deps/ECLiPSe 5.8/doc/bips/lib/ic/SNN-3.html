<H1>$::(?Var, ++Domain, ?Bool)</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Provides a reified form of the $::/2 domain assignment predicate.  This
   reified $::/3 is defined only to work for one variable and real 
   variables (unlike ::/3), hence only the Domain formats suitable for
   reals may be supplied to this reified $::/3.
   <P>
   For a single variable, V, the Bool will be instantiated to 0 if the
   current domain of V does not intersect with Domain.  It will be
   instantiated to 1 iff the domain of V is wholly contained within Domain.
   Finally the Boolean will remain an integer variable in the range 0..1, if
   neither of the above two conditions hold.
   <P>
   Instantiating Bool to 1, will cause the constraint to behave exactly like
   $::/2.  Instatiating Bool to 0 will cause a set of delayed goals to
   excluded the range from the domain of the variable where such an
   exclusion is representable.
   <P>
   Note that calling the reified form of $:: will NOT result in the Variable
   becoming constrained to be integral, even if domain contains only integers.
   <P>
   Further note that, like other reified predicates, $:: can be used infix in
   an IC expression, e.g. B #= (X $:: [1..10]) is equivalent to
   $::(X, [1..10], B).

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>[eclipse 2]: $::(X, 1..30,1).

X = X{1.0 .. 30.0}
Yes (0.00s cpu)

[eclipse 3]: $::(X, [1..10, 12..30],0).

Abort
type error in $::(X, [1 .. 10, 12 .. 30], 0)

[eclipse 4]: $::(X, 1.0..30.0,B).

X = X{-1.0Inf .. 1.0Inf}
B = B{[0, 1]}
There are 3 delayed goals.
Yes (0.00s cpu)
