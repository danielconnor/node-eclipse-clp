ac_eq(?X, ?Y, ++C)

   Arc-consistent implementation of X #= Y + C.

Arguments
   X                   Variable or integer
   Y                   Variable or integer
   C                   Integer constant

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   This constraint implements an arc-consistent version of X #= Y + C (i.e.
   any "holes" in the domain of X are propagated to Y and vice-versa).

   X and Y are constrained to be integral and to have "reasonable" bounds
   (roughly +/- 2^30 on a 32-bit machine, roughly +/- 2^52 on a 64-bit
   machine: note that if such large bounds are actually used then available
   memory is likely to be exhausted very rapidly, if not immediately).
