get_integer_bounds(?Var, -Lo, -Hi)

   Retrieve the current bounds of (integral) Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Lo                  Lower bound
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Primitive for retrieving the upper and lower bounds of (integral) Var.
   Lo and Hi return the minimum and maximum (respectively) of the variable's
   interval.  If Var has not been declared before, it will be turned into an
   unrestricted integer variable.  If Var is a real IC variable, it will be
   constrained to be integral.  (These changes may cause propagation.)
   Infinite bounds are returned as floating point numbers; all others are
   returned as integers.  If Var is a ground integer, Lo and Hi will unified
   with that integer.  All other cases result in a type error.
