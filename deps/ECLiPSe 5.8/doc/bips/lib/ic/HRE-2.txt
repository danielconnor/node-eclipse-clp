?ExprX #\= ?ExprY

   ExprX is not equal to ExprY (with integrality constraints).

Arguments
   ExprX               Integer arithmetic expression
   ExprY               Integer arithmetic expression

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Constrains ExprX to be not equal to ExprY.  Also constrains all variables
   appearing in ExprX and ExprY to be integral and checks that all constants
   are integers.

   Note that if all variables and constants appearing in this constraint
   are already integral, then the constraint is equivalent to
   ic:(ExprX =\= ExprY).
