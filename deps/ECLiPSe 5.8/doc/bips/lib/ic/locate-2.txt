locate(+Vars, ++Precision)

   Locate solution intervals for Vars by splitting and search.

Arguments
   Vars                List of variables
   Precision           Minimum required precision (float)

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Locate solution intervals for the given variables with the required
   precision.  This works well if the problem has a finite number of
   solutions.  locate/2,3 work by nondeterministically splitting the
   intervals of the variables until they are narrower than Precision (in
   either absolute or relative terms).

   locate/2 is defined in terms of locate/3 as follows:
    
    locate(Vars, Precision) :- locate(Vars, Precision, log).
