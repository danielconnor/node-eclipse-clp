is_in_domain(++Val, ?Var)

   Succeeds iff Val is in the domain of Var

Arguments
   Val                 A number
   Var                 An IC variable or a number

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Low level predicate which succeeds when Val is in the domain of Var.  If
   Var is a number, this predicate will succeed iff Var $= Val would succeed
   WITHOUT leaving a delayed goal.


Exceptions
     4 --- Val is not ground
     5 --- either Val or Var is not a numeric type
   undecidable comparison of bounded reals --- Val was a bounded real which overlapped a bound of Var
