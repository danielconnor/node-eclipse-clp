?ExprX #> ?ExprY

   ExprX is strictly greater than ExprY (with integrality constraints).

Arguments
   ExprX               Integer arithmetic expression
   ExprY               Integer arithmetic expression

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Constrains ExprX to be greater than ExprY.  Also constrains all variables
   appearing in ExprX and ExprY to be integral and checks that all constants
   are integers.
