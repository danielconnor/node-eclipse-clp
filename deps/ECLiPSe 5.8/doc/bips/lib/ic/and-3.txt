and(+ConX,+ConY,Bool)

   Bool is the reified truth of both constraints ConX and ConY being true.

Arguments
   ConX                Constraint
   ConY                Constraint
   Bool                Reified truth value of the constraint

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Equivalent to BX $= (ConX), BY $= (ConY), Bool #= (BX + BY #= 2)
   
   The two constraints are reified in such a way that Bool reflects the
   truth of both being true.  ConX and ConY must be constraints that have a
   corresponding reified form.
