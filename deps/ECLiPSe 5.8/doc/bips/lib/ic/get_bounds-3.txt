get_bounds(?Var, -Lo, -Hi)

   Retrieve the current bounds of Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Lo                  Lower bound
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Primitive for retrieving the upper and lower bounds of Var.  Lo and Hi
   return the minimum and maximum (respectively) of the variable's interval.
   If the variable is integer and a bound is finite, then that bound will be
   returned as an integer; in all other cases it will be returned as a
   float.  If Var has not been declared before, it will be turned into an
   unrestricted real variable.  If Var is a ground number, Lo and Hi will
   give appropriate bounds based on the type and value of Var: exact bounds
   for floats, bounded reals and integers, and best safe approximations for
   rationals.
