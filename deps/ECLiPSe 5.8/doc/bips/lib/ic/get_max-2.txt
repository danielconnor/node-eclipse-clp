get_max(?Var, -Hi)

   Retrieve the current upper bound of Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Primitive for retrieving the upper bound of Var.  Hi returns the maximum
   of the variable's interval.  If the variable is integer and the bound is
   finite, then the bound will be returned as an integer; in all other cases
   it will be returned as a float.  If Var has not been declared before, it
   will be turned into an unrestricted real variable.  If Var is a ground
   number, Hi will give an appropriate bound based on the type and value of
   Var: an exact bound for floats, bounded reals and integers, and a best
   safe approximation for rationals.
