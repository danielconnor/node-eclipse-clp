get_finite_integer_bounds(?Var, -Lo, -Hi)

   Retrieve the current (finite, integral) bounds of Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Lo                  Lower bound
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Primitive for retrieving the (finite, integral) upper and lower bounds of
   Var.  Lo and Hi return the minimum and maximum (respectively) of the
   variable's interval.  If Var has not been declared before, it will be
   turned into an integer variable.  If Var is a real IC variable, it will
   be constrained to be integral.  If any bound is infinite, it has a
   default bound imposed to make it finite (-10000000 for lower bounds,
   10000000 for upper bounds).  (These changes may cause propagation.)
   Bounds are always returned as integers.  If Var is a ground integer, Lo
   and Hi will unified with that integer.  All other cases result in a type
   error.
