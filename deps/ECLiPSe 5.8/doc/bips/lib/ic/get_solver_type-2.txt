Description

   Retrieve the type (the atom 'real' or the atom 'integer') of a variable
   (or number).  If Var has not been declared before, it will be turned into
   an unrestricted real variable.  If Var is a ground number, the type
   returned will be appropriate for its type (i.e. if it's not an integer,
   the type returned will be real).


Fail Conditions
   Var is not a variable or a number.
