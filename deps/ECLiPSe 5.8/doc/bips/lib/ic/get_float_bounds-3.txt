get_float_bounds(?Var, -Lo, -Hi)

   Retrieve the current bounds of Var as floats.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Lo                  Lower bound
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Primitive for retrieving the upper and lower bounds of Var.  Lo and Hi
   return the minimum and maximum (respectively) of the variable's interval
   in floating point format (regardless of the variable's type).  If Var has
   not been declared before, it will be turned into an unrestricted real
   variable.  If Var is a ground number, Lo and Hi will give appropriate
   bounds based on the type and value of Var: exact bounds for floats,
   bounded reals and exactly representable integers, and best safe
   approximations for large integers and rationals.
