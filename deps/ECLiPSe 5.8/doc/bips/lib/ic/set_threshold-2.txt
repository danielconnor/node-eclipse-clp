set_threshold(++Threshold, +WakeVars)

   Sets the propagation threshold with recomputation.

Arguments
   Threshold           New threshold (float)
   WakeVars            List of IC variables to "wake"

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Set the threshold to Threshold, which is a small floating-point number,
   and then if the threshold has been reduced, wake all constraints
   suspended on the bounds of the variables in the list WakeVars.
   Subsequent to the setting of the new threshold, bounds updates to
   non-integer variables are only performed if the change in the bounds
   exceeds this threshold (in both absolute and relative terms).  The waking
   of the constraints when the threshold is reduced allows part or all of
   the system to be re-propagated in order to ensure the higher level of
   precision is achieved before the rest of the computation proceeds.

   The default threshold is 1e-8.

   Limiting the amount of propagation is important for efficiency.  A higher
   threshold speeds up computations, but reduces precision and may in the
   extreme case prevent the system from being able to locate individual
   solutions.
