Description
This predicate provides a flexible way to assign values to finite 
domain variables.
The available methods are:

min Start the enumeration from the smallest value upwards. 
    This behaves like the built-in indomain/1, except that it
    removes previously tested values on backtracking.

max Start the enumeration from the largest value
    downwards.

middle Try the enumeration starting from the middle of the
    domain.  On backtracking, this chooses alternatively values above and
    below the middle value, until all alternatives have been tested.

median Try the enumeration starting from the median value
    of the domain.  On backtracking, this chooses alternatively values
    above and below the median value, until all alternatives have been
    tested.

split Try the enumeration by splitting the domain
    successively into halves until a ground value is reached.  This
    sometimes can detect failure earlier than the normal enumeration
    methods, but enumerates the values in the same order as min.

interval If the domain consists of several intervals, then
    we branch first on the choice of the interval.  For one interval, we
    use domain splitting.

random Try the enumeration in a random order.  On
    backtracking, the previously tested value is removed.  This method
    uses random/1 to create random numbers, use seed/1
    before to make results reproducible.

Value:integer Like middle, but start with the given integer
    Value

sbds_min Like min, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking library).

sbds_max Like max, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking library).

sbds_middle Like middle, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking library).

sbds_median Like median, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking library).

sbds_random Like random, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking library).

sbds(Value:integer) Like Value:integer, but use sbds_try/2
    to make choices (for use in conjunction with the SBDS symmetry breaking
    library).

gap_sbds_min Like min, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking library,
    lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbds_max Like max, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking library,
    lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbds_middle Like middle, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbds_median Like median, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbds_random Like random, but use sbds_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbds(Value:integer) Like Value:integer, but use sbds_try/2
    to make choices (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDS symmetry
    breaking library, lib(ic_gap_sbds)).

gap_sbdd_min Like min, but use sbdd_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking library,
    lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

gap_sbdd_max Like max, but use sbdd_try/2 to make choices (for
    use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking library,
    lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

gap_sbdd_middle Like middle, but use sbdd_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

gap_sbdd_median Like median, but use sbdd_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

gap_sbdd_random Like random, but use sbdd_try/2 to make choices
    (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking
    library, lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

gap_sbdd(Value:integer) Like Value:integer, but use sbdd_try/2
    to make choices (for use in conjunction with the GAP-based SBDD symmetry
    breaking library, lib(ic_gap_sbdd)).

On backtracking, all methods first remove the previously tested value
before choosing a new one.  This sometimes can have a huge impact on
the constraint propagation, and normally does not cause much overhead,
even if no additional propagation occurs.
