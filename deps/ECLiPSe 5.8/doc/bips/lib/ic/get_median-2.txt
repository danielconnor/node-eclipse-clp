get_median(?Var, -Median)

   Returns the median of the interval of the IC variable Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or a number
   Median              The median of the interval

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Returns the median of the interval of Var (usually so that the interval
   can be split).  If Var has not been declared before, it will be turned
   into an unrestricted real variable.  If Var is a ground number, the
   median will be calculated appropriately based on its type.

   If the interval crosses 0, then the median is 0.  Otherwise, the median
   splits the interval logarithmically so that the two subintervals have the
   same number of representable floats.


Examples
   [eclipse 2]: X :: 10..1000, get_median(X, M).
X = X{10 .. 1000}
M = 100.0
Yes (0.00s cpu)

[eclipse 3]: X :: -1..1000, get_median(X, M).
X = X{-1 .. 1000}
M = 0.0
Yes (0.00s cpu)
