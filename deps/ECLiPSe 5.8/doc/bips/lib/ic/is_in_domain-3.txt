is_in_domain(++Val, ?Var, ?Result)

   Binds Result to indicate presence of Val in domain of Var

Arguments
   Val                 A number
   Var                 An IC variable or a number
   Result              An atom

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Low level predicate which succeeds when Val is in the domain of Var with
   Result bound to the atom 'yes'.  When Val is not in the domain of Var,
   the predicate succeeds binding Result to the atom 'no'.  Should the
   result be undecidable (as can be the case with bounded reals), the
   predicate will succeed binding Result to the atom 'maybe'.  If Var is a
   number, this predicate will succeed with Result bound to 'yes' iff
   Var $= Val would succeed WITHOUT leaving a delayed goal.  If Var $= Val
   would have left a delayed goal then Result gets bound to 'maybe'.


Exceptions
     4 --- Val is not ground
     5 --- either Val or Var is not a numeric type
