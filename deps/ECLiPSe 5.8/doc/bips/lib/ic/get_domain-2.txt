get_domain(?Var, ?Domain)

   Returns a ground representation of the current IC domain of a variable.

Arguments
   Var                 An IC variable or a number.
   Domain              A ground representation of the domain of Var.

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   If Var is a number, Domain will be unified with that number.

   If Var is a real IC variable, Domain will be unified with the term
   Lo..Hi where Lo and Hi are floats corresponding to the current lower
   and upper bounds of Var, respectively.

   If Var is an integer IC variable with no holes in its domain, Domain will
   be unified with the term Lo..Hi where Lo and Hi are integers
   corresponding to the current lower and upper bounds of Var, respectively.

   If Var is an integer IC variable with holes in its domain, Domain will
   be unified with an ordered list of integers and/or terms Lo..Hi where Lo
   and Hi are integers; in this case the elements of the domain of Var are
   exactly those integers appearing directly in the list or falling within
   any of the intervals Lo..Hi.


Fail Conditions
   The initial value of DomainList fails to unify with the returned value.

Exceptions
     5 --- Var is neither an IC variable or number.
     6 --- Var is a IC variable of type real.
