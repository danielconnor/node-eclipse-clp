Arguments
   Var                 An integer IC variable or an integer

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Simple predicate for instantiating an integer IC variable to an element
   of its domain.  It starts with the smallest element, and upon
   backtracking tries successive elements until the entire domain has been
   explored, at which point the predicate fails.

   If Var is already a ground integer, then this predicate simply succeeds
   exactly once without leaving a choicepoint.


Resatisfiable
   Yes.
