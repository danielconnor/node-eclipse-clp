=>(+ConX,+ConY,Bool)

   Bool is the reified truth of constraint ConX implying the truth of ConY.

Arguments
   ConX                Constraint
   ConY                Constraint
   Bool                Reified truth value of the constraint

Type
   library(ic)

Description

   Equivalent to BX $= (ConX), BY $= (ConY), Bool #= (BX #=
   
   The two constraints are reified in such a way that Bool is true if ConX
   being true implies that ConY must also be true.  ConX and ConY must be
   constraints that have a corresponding reified form.
