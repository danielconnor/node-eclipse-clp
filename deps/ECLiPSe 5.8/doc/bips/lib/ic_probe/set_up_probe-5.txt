set_up_probe(+Tasks, +Constraints, -Cost, ++Options, -Handle)

   Sets up a linear probe for a set of constraints

Arguments
   Tasks               A term containing some variables
   Constraints         A list of numerical constraints
   Cost                A cost variable
   Options             An options structure
   Handle              A variable which will record the handle of the matrix 
used by the linear solver

Type
   library(ic_probe)

Description

The constraints are passed to add_con, which adds them to both the 
ic and linear solvers.  The cost is declared to be an integer.  

lp_demon_setup is then invoked to set up the linear solver, with the 
priority specified in the Options parameter.  Solutions returned
by the linear solver are automatically used to update the tentative values  
of all the variables.



Resatisfiable
   no

Examples
   
?- Options = options{granularity:3,priority:5},
   Cost=X1,
   set_up_probe([X1,X2,X3],[X1>X2,X2>X3],Cost,Options,H).
