lib(ic_probe)


    This implementation of probing is a call to an external linear solver, 
    whose optimal solution is assigned to the problem variables as tentative 
    variables.

A counter is created an initialised to zero.  At every probe it is incremented.
The counter can be set using set_probect(N), and can be read using 
get_probect(N)
