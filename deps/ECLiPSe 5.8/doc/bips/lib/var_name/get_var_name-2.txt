Description
	
	  Used to retrieve the unique name that was given to a variable via
	  the set_var_name/2 predicate. This name is always of the form
	  BaseName#N, where BaseName is the base name that was specified in
	  set_var_name/2, and N is an integer.
	
	  These variable names are intended solely for purposes of debugging
	  and visualisation of a program execution. Any use of this feature
	  in the actual program logic or algorithm is strongly discouraged.
	
	

Fail Conditions
