lib(var_name)

    
    The var_name library is used to allow variables to be given unique and
    stable names. These names are printed whenever the variable is printed.
    The main novel feature is that the name is unique at any time, and that
    this name is stable in that it would not change between runs of the same
    program.
    
    These variable names are intended solely for purposes of debugging
    and visualisation of a program execution. Any use of this feature
    in the actual program logic or algorithm is strongly discouraged.
