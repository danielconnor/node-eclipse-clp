set_var_name_counter(++BaseName, ++Start)

   Set the initial value for the counter for variable name BaseName.

Arguments
   BaseName            A valid base-name (atom or string)
   Start               Start value for counter (integer)

Type
   library(var_name)

Description
    
	Set the initial counter value for a variable name BaseName that will
        then be used in set_var_name/2, with Start as the initial value of 
        the counter. If BaseName already exists (i.e. variables have already
        been named using BaseName), the predicate will fail.

    
        It is expected that the main use of this predicate will be to change
        the default counter start value from 0 to 1. However, no restrictions 
        are placed on what the start value may be.


Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   BaseName already exists.

Exceptions
     5 --- BaseName is not an atom or string.
     5 --- Start is not an integer.
     6 --- BaseName does not begin with a capital letter.
