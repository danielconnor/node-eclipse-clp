    Measure the system's speed in logical inferences per second, using
    the infamous naive reverse program. This test does not say very much
    about the quality of a system. All it gives is an indication about
    the speed of list processing.
    
    The executed program is:
    
    nreverse([], []).
    nreverse([X|L0],L) :-
	    nreverse(L0, L1),
	    concatenate(L1, [X], L).

    concatenate([], L, L).
    concatenate([X|L1], L2, [X|L3]) :-
	    concatenate(L1, L2, L3).
    
    and the standard benchmark is to call nreverse/2 with a 30-element
    list as the first and a variable as the second argument.  This
    instance is assumed to have 496 logical inferences.
