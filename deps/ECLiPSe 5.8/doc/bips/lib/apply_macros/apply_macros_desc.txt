lib(apply_macros)


    Note that this library is largely superseded by the do-loop construct!
    
    A collection of utilities to apply a predicate to
    all elements of a list resp. all subterm of a term.
    To avoid performance degradation due to apply/2,
    they are implemented as macros, i.e. they are specialized
    into auxiliary predicates without metacalls, and the
    calls are translated into calls of the auxiliary predicates.
