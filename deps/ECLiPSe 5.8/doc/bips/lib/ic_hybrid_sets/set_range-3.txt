set_range(?Set, -Lwb, -Upb)

   Lwb and Upb are the current lower and upper bounds on Set

Arguments
   Set                 A variable or an integer list
   Lwb                 List of integers
   Upb                 List of integers

Type
   library(ic_hybrid_sets)

Description

    Returns two sorted, duplicate-free lists of integers which represent
    the lower and upper bound of the set variable (or the ground set) Set.
    The predicate can also be used as a test for set-variables, since it
    fails for any other (in particular domain-less) variables.


Fail Conditions
   Set is a variable, but not a set variable
