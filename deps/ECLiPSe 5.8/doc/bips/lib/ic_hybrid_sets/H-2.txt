#(?Set, ?Card)

   Card is the cardinality of the integer set Set

Arguments
   Set                 a set, set variable or set expression
   Card                a variable, finite domain variable, or integer

Type
   library(ic_hybrid_sets)

Description

    This is a constraint for the cardinality of the set Set.
    Any changes in the potential cardinality of Set will be reflected
    in the finite domain of Card. Restricting the domain of Card will
    restrict the potential cardinality of Set.


Exceptions
     4 --- Set is a variable, but not a set variable
