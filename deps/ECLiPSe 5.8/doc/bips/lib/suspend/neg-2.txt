neg(?Expr, ?Bool)

   Reified boolean operation

Arguments
   Expr                An arithmetic expression
   Bool                Variable, 0 or 1

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
    Reified version of neg/1, i.e. the truth value of the boolean operation
    is reflected in the value of the 0/1 variable Bool.

    This constraint suspends until its first argument is ground.
    It then unifies Bool according to the truth value of the corresponding
    neg/1 constraint.


Exceptions
    24 --- Expr is not an arithmetic expression.
