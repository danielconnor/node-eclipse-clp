#::(?Vars, ?Range, ?Bool)

   Reified range constraint combined with integrality constraint

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or integer, or a list of variables or integers
   Range               Variable or Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are variables or integer expressions
   Bool                Variable, 0 or 1

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
    Reified version of #::/2, i.e. the truth value of the range constraint is
    reflected in the value of the 0/1 variable Bool.

    This constraint suspends until its first two arguments are ground.
    It then unifies Bool according to the truth value of the corresponding
    #::/2 constraint.

    Note: as opposed to #::/2, the first argument cannot be a list.
    

Exceptions
     5 --- Range contains non-integers.

Examples
   
    ?- #::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 3.
    B = 1
    X = 3
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    % range violated
    ?- #::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 6.
    B = 0
    X = 6
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    % integrality violated
    ?- #::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 3.0.
    B = 0
    X = 3.0
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
