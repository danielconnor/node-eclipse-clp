?Vars #:: ?Range

   Range constraint combined with integrality constraint

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or integer, or a list of variables or integers
   Range               Variable or Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are variables or integer expressions

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
   This constraint suspends until its arguments are ground. It then succeeds
   iff all the elements of the list Vars are integers within the range
   specified by Range.

   The range must eventually be in the form Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are 
   expressions evaluating to integers.

Fail Conditions
   Vars contains non-integers or integers that do not fall within Range.

Exceptions
     5 --- Range contains non-integers.

Examples
   
    ?- X #:: 1 .. 5, X = 3.
    X = 3
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X #:: 1 .. 5, X = 6.
    No (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X #:: 1 .. 5, X = 3.0.
    No (0.00s cpu)
