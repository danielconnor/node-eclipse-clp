=>(?Expr1, ?Expr2, ?Bool)

   Reified boolean operation

Arguments
   Expr1               An arithmetic expression
   Expr2               An arithmetic expression
   Bool                Variable, 0 or 1

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
    Reified version of =>/2, i.e. the truth value of the boolean operation
    is reflected in the value of the 0/1 variable Bool.

    This constraint suspends until its first two arguments are ground.
    It then unifies Bool according to the truth value of the corresponding
    =>/2 constraint.


Exceptions
    24 --- Expr1 or Expr2 is not an arithmetic expression.
