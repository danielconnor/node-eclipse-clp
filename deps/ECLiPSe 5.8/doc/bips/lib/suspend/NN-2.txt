?Vars :: ?Range

   Range constraint with optional integrality constraint

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or number, or a list of variables or numbers
   Range               Variable or Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are variables or numeric expressions

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
   This constraint suspends until its arguments are ground. It then succeeds
   iff all the elements of the list Vars are numbers within the range
   specified by Range.

   The range must eventually be in the form Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are 
   expressions evaluating to numbers. If both are integers, then Vars must
   also be integers (integer or list of integers).

Fail Conditions
   Vars contains numbers that do not fall within Range, or violate the optional integrality constraint.

Examples
   
    % with integrality constraint
    ?- X :: 1 .. 5, X = 3.
    X = 3
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X :: 1 .. 5, X = 6.
    No (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X :: 1 .. 5, X = 3.0.
    No (0.00s cpu)

    % without integrality constraint
    ?- X :: 1.0 .. 5.0, X = 3.
    X = 3
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X :: 1.0 .. 5.0, X = 3.0.
    X = 3.0
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
