#=<(?Expr1, ?Expr2, ?Bool)

   Reified arithmetic comparison

Arguments
   Expr1               An arithmetic expression
   Expr2               An arithmetic expression
   Bool                Variable, 0 or 1

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
    Reified version of #=
    This constraint suspends until its first two arguments are ground.

    #=</2 constraint.


Exceptions
