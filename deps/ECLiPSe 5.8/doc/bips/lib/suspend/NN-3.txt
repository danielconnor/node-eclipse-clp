::(?Var, ?Range, ?Bool)

   Reified range constraint with optional integrality constraint

Arguments
   Var                 Variable or number
   Range               Variable or Lo..Hi, where Lo and Hi are variables or numeric expressions
   Bool                Variable, 0 or 1

Type
   library(suspend)

Description
    Reified version of ::/2, i.e. the truth value of the range constraint is
    reflected in the value of the 0/1 variable Bool.

    This constraint suspends until its first two arguments are ground.
    It then unifies Bool according to the truth value of the corresponding
    ::/2 constraint.

    Note: as opposed to ::/2, the first argument cannot be a list.
    

Examples
   
    ?- ::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 3.
    B = 1
    X = 3
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- ::(X, 1.0 .. 5.0, B), X = 3.0.
    B = 1
    X = 3.0
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    % range violated
    ?- ::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 6.
    B = 0
    X = 6
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    % integrality violated
    ?- ::(X, 1 .. 5, B), X = 3.0.
    B = 0
    X = 3.0
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
