lib(conjunto_fd_sets)


    This is a wrapper for library(fd_sets) to make it more backward
    compatible with its predecessor, the set solver library(conjunto).
    Supported are:
    
    the curly-bracket syntax for sets (input only)
    the backquote-syntax for several constraints (`<>,`<,`::,`=)
    refine/1
    
    Not supported are:
    
    non-integer set elements
    el_weight/2, sum_weight/2 (but see fd_sets:weight/2)
    max_weight/2 (but see fd_sets:insetdomain/4)
