make_overlap_bivs(+Tasks, -BivLists, -BivSums, ++Resource, ++Options)

   Make a set of overlap bivalued variables for a set of tasks.
Introduce a set of 'bivalued sum' variables, equal to the sum of the binaries at
an overlap.  The bivalued sum variables represent the total resources needed

Arguments
   Tasks               A list of task structures - see <B>probe_lib</B>
   BivLists            A list of lists of integer variables
   BivSums             A list of integer variables, each one the sum of a list 
                      of binaries
   Resource            An integer quantity of resource available
   Options             An options structure

Type
   library(ic_make_overlap_bivs)

Description

    Based on the tentative assignments, probe_search finds a task
    start time where the resources are not sufficient to make the
    tentative assignment feasible.  In case a bottleneck task has a
    variable resource requirement, this is reduced to its minimum
    possible value. Otherwise, probe_search chooses a bivalued
    'overlap' variable at this bottleneck and using add_con it adds 
    a constraint trying to eliminate the overlap.



Resatisfiable
   no
