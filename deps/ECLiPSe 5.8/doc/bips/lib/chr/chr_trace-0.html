<H1>chr_trace</H1>
Activates the standard debugger and shows constraint handling.


<DL>

<H2>Description</H2>
   In order to use the standard debugger, the debug_compile must have been
   on (default) during compilation (chr to pl) and loading of the produced
   ECLiPSe  code.  The query chr_trace.  activates the standard debugger
   showing more information about the handling of constraints.  In the
   standard debugger, user-defined constraints are treated as predicates
   and the information about application of constraint handling rules is
   displayed without stopping.  The additional information displayed is:

<P>
  * add:  A new constraint is added to the constraint store.

<P>
  * already_in:  A constraint to be added was already present.

<P>
   The ports related to application of rules are:

<P>
  * try_rule:  A rule is tried.

<P>
  * delay_rule:  The last tried rule cannot fire because the guard did not
    succeed.

<P>
  * fire_rule:  The last tried rule fires.

<P>
   The ports related to labeling are:
  * try_label:  A label_with declaration is checked.

<P>
  * delay_label:  The last label_with declaration delays because the guard
    did not succeed.

<P>
  * fire_label:  The last tried label_with declaration succeeds, so the
    clauses of the associated constraint will be used for built-in
    labeling.

<P>
   When displayed, each constraint is labeled with a unique integer
   identifier.  Each rule is labeled with its name as given in the chr
   source using the @ operator.  If a rule does not have a name, it is
   displayed together with a unique integer identifier.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
