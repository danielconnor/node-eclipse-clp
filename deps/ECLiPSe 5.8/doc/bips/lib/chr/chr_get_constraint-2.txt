chr_get_constraint(Variable,?Constraint)

   Remove a constraint in which the variable Variable occurs and which unifies
with Constraint from the constraint store.



Arguments
   Variable            A free variable.
   ?Constraint         A constraint (callable term) defined by constraint handling                rules.

Type
   library(chr)

Description
   Removes a constraint in which the variable Variable occurs and which
   unifies with Constraint from the constraint store.  Note that if the
   unification with Constraint binds variables occurring also in other
   constraints in the constraint store, these constraints may be simplified
   (see last examples).  Thus it is recommended to use either a free
   variable or a term with variable arguments for Constraint.  Used by
   advanced constraint handling rules users to manipulate themselves the
   constraints defined by constraint handling rules.  See also
   chr_get_constraint/1 for more examples.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Variable is not a free variable or if there is no constraint
   (defined by constraint handling rules) in the constraint store that
   unifies with Constraint and in which the variable Variable occurs.



Examples
      Example using the constraint handler for Booleans  bool.chr:
[eclipse]: and(X,Y,Z), or(A,B,C), chr_get_constraint(Y,Cstr).

X = X
Z = Z
A = A
B = B
Y = Y
Cstr = X * Y = Z

Constraints:
(2) A + B = C   % pretty print for or/3 - constraint

     More? (;)

no (more) solution.


   The following predicate labeling(+Varlist) labels the variables in the
   list Varlist:
labeling([X|VL]) :-
   var(X),
   chr_get_constraint(X,C),
   chr_label_with(C),
   !,
   chr_resolve(C),
   labeling([X|VL]).

labeling([X|VL]) :-
   labeling(VL).

labeling([]).
