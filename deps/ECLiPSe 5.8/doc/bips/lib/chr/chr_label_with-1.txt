chr_label_with(+Constraint)

   Checks the label_with declarations of Constraint.



Arguments
   +Constraint         A chr constraint.

Type
   library(chr)

Description
   Checks the label_with declarations of Constraint.  Used by advanced
   constraint handling rules users to write their own labeling procedure
   for the constraints defined by constraint handling rules.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Constraint is a variable or if Constraint does not have a
   label_with declaration or if the guard of all unifying label_with
   declarations fail.



Examples
      Given the following  label_with declaration (from the example
   constraint handler in file  time-pc.chr:
label_with path(N, X, Y, L, T, I) if N>1.

[eclipse]: chr_label_with(path(N,X,Y,L,T,I)).
no (more) solution.

[eclipse]: chr_label_with(path(1,X,Y,L,T,I)).
no (more) solution.

[eclipse]: chr_label_with(path(2,X,Y,L,T,I)).
X = X
Y = Y
L = L
T = T
I = I     More? (;)
no (more) solution.
