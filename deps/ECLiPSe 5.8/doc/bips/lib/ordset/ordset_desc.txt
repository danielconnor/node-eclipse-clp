lib(ordset)

	This library implements sets as ordered lists.  The benefit of the
	ordered representation is that the elementary set operations can
	be done in time proportional to the Sum of the argument sizes
	rather than their Product.  Some of the unordered set routines,
	such as member/2, length/2,, select/3 can be used unchanged.
