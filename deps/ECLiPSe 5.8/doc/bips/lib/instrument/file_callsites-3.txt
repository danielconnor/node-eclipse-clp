file_callsites(+File, ?StartId, ?EndId)

   Retrieve start and end callsite identifiers for named file.

Arguments
   File                Atom or string
   StartId             Intger
   EndId               Integer

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   Each code instrumentation point within a file is 
   uniquely identified by its callsite identifier.
   The callsite identifier is a monotonically increasing 
   integer incrementing from the initial value of 0 for a 
   new module. 
   
   As additional files are instrumented and 
   compiled into a module, the start identifier is 
   incremented from the end identifier of the previous file. 
   The predicate retrieves the start and end callsite 
   identifiers for the file.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the callsite identifiers 
   of a file instrumented in a module other than the current 
   calling module context can be retrieved by invoking 
   file_callsites(File, StartId, EndId)@Module.

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   StartId or EndId are not the file's starting and 
    ending callsite identifiers.
