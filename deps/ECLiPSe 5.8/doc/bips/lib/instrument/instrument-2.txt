instrument(+File, +ITemplates)

   Compile a file, inserting predicate instrumentation

Arguments
   File                Atom or string
   ITemplates          itemplate, List of itemplate or PredSpec

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   This is a variant of the ECLiPSe compiler that inserts user specified 
   instrumentation predicates into the compiled code. This code can then 
   be run, and the results analysed by printing them using 
   instrument:module_result/0 or instrument:file_result/1.
   
   ITemplates can be specified as:
   
   PredSpec of arity two
   
   If an arity two predicate specification is supplied, then this predicate 
   is invoked in order to retrieve the template for the predicate being 
   instrumented. Argument one is the predicate specification of the 
   predicate undergoing instrumentation. Argument two is an output variable
   that is to be returned by this predicate as the template to use. The 
   returned itemplate will be validated before instrumentation 
   proceeds.
   
   itemplate
   
   A single template passed to instrument/2 or instrument/3 
   is adopted as the global template to be used for predicate 
   instrumentation. If a template for the predicate currently being 
   instrumented is not found in the template stores then if a global template 
   exists, it is used.
   
   PredSpec = itemplate
   
   A template specification for instrumentation of a single predicate. If 
   however, PredSpec is not actually a valid predicate specification but 
   the atom iglobal, the template is adopted as the global template 
   (see above).
   
   List of itemplate
   
   The list is of the form: 
   [itemplate{...} | PredSpec = itemplate{...} ... 
   PredSpec = itemplate{...}]
   The itemplate at the head of the list is specifies the global 
   template and is optional. The remaining elements of the list are 
   itemplate specifying instrumentation for the PredSpec with which 
   they are associated.
   
   In addition to supplying the global template, an exclude list of 
   PredSpec for predicates that should not be instrumented by the global 
   template can be specified:
   itemplate{...} - 
   predicate/1, my_module:my_predicate/8,...]

Exceptions
     4 --- ITemplates is not instantiated.
     5 --- ITemplates is not of the appropriate type.
