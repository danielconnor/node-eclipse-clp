module_result(+OptionList)

   Pretty-print all files in a module, including any 
   instrumentation results

Arguments
   OptionList          List of options

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   This will pretty-print all source files in the calling
   module context, annotated with the result of instrumentation. 
   The resulting .html files are placed in a sub-directory called 
   instrument', relative to the files that were compiled into the file.
   
   OptionList is a list of options identical to the one accepted by 
   pretty_print/2 in the library(pretty_printer), and can be 
   used to modify the output style and the location of the output file.
   
   Additionally, OptionList may contain the following options:
   
   ignore_module_templates (default:off)
   
   Specifying this option as on results in the 
   use of file local templates only during instrumentation. 
   Templates are not sought from the global store.
   
   This option should only be specified if it was also specified 
   during instrumentation (i.e. when using 
   instrument:instrument/3).
   
   macro_expansion (default:off)
   
   This option affects only the printing of the result (html) file. 
   By default, read-macros are not expanded in this output. 
   In rare cases, where macro expansion would affect the placement of 
   instrumentation positions, it may be necessary to set 
   this option to on in order to display the instrumentation 
   at the correct positions in the code.
   
   
   verbose (default:off)
   
   If set to on, the instrument preprocessor 
   will print predicate names as they are processed (to 
   log_output). 
   If set to debug, the instrument preprocessor 
   prints each instrumented and/or woven predicate definition (to 
   log_output).
   
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has 
   previously been instrumented and compiled 
   using instrument:instrument/1,2, and the code has been 
   run in order to obtain instrumentation results.
   
   See struct(itemplate) for documentation of how the 
   result instrumentation is used in the annotation and pretty-printing 
   of the code.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the instrumentation results of a 
   module other than the current calling module context can be obtained 
   by invoking module_result(OptionList)@Module.
