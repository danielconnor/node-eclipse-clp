instrument_control(+Mode, +InstrumentPredSpec)

   Insert or remove instrumentation predicates dynamically 
   at runtime.

Arguments
   Mode                Atom
   InstrumentPredSpec  PredSpec

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   If the asserted option of an itemplate 
   is set to one of on, off or 
   post_compile then the template's instrumentation 
   predicates may be inserted and removed dynamically at runtime.
   
   When Mode is on the instrumentation predicate 
   represented is PredSpec is inserted into the code at the 
   positions specified during instrumentation. This is done 
   efficiently with negligible runtime overhead. When Mode is 
   off the instrumentation predicate is removed from 
   the instrumented code.
   
   If PredSpec is module qualified, the instrumentation predicate 
   defined in the context of the module is inserted / removed. If 
   unqualified the predicate is assumed to be defined in the context 
   of the calling module scope.
   
   The predicate is a tool and an unqualified instrumentation 
   predicate defined in a module other than the current 
   calling module context can be inserted / removed by invoking 
   instrument_control(Mode, InstrumentPredSpec)@Module.

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   InstrumentPredSpec is not a predicate specification.

Exceptions
    68 --- PredSpec is an undefined procedure.
