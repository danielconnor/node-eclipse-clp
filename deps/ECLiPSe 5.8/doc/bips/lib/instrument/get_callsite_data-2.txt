get_callsite_data(+SiteId, ?UserData)

   Retrieve data associated with an instrumentation callsite 
   from its non-logical store.

Arguments
   SiteId              Integer
   UserData            Valid Prolog term

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   Each code instrumentation point within a file is uniquely identified 
   by its callsite identifier. The callsite identifier is a monotonically 
   increasing integer incrementing from the initial value of 0 for a new 
   module. 
   
   The predicate retrieves the data (a valid Prolog term) that has been 
   associated with the specified instrumentation callsite within a module 
   or file.
   
   The data is stored in a non-logical store and can be stored using 
   instrument:set_callsite_data/2.
   
   The predicate is a tool and data for a callsite of a module other than 
   the current calling module context can be retrieved by invoking 
   get_callsite_data(SiteId, UserData)@Module.

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Data has not been stored for callsite identifier SiteId.

Exceptions
     4 --- SiteId is not instantiated.
     5 --- SiteId is not an integer.
