file_result(+File)

   Pretty-print a file, including any instrumentation results

Arguments
   File                Atom or string

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   This will pretty-print the specified source file in the calling 
   module context, annotated with the result of instrumentation. 
   The resulting .html file is placed in a sub-directory called 
   instrument', relative to File.
   
   See file_result/2 for options to modify the output.
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has 
   previously been instrumented and compiled 
   using instrument:instrument/1,2, and the code has been 
   run in order to obtain instrumentation results.
   
   See struct(itemplate) for documentation of how the 
   result instrumentation is used in the annotation and pretty-printing 
   of the code.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the instrumentation results of a 
   file in an alternate module to the current calling module context 
   can be obtained invoking file_result(File)@Module.
