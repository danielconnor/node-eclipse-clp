module_result

   Pretty-print all files in a module, including any 
    instrumentation results

Arguments

Type
   library(instrument)

Description

   This will pretty-print all source files in the calling module context, 
   annotated with the result of instrumentation.  The resulting .html 
   files are placed in a sub-directory called instrument', relative to 
   the files that were compiled into the file.
   
   See module_result/1 for options to modify the output.
   
   The use of this predicate is only meaningful if the module has 
   previously been instrumented and compiled 
   using instrument:instrument/1,2, and the code has been 
   run in order to obtain instrumentation results.
   
   See struct(itemplate) for documentation of how the 
   result instrumentation is used in the annotation and pretty-printing 
   of the code.
   
   The predicate is a tool and the instrumentation results of a 
   module other than the current calling module context can be obtained 
   by invoking module_result@Module.
