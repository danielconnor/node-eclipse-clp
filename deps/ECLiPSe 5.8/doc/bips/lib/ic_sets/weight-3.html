According to the array of element weights, the weight of set Set is Weight

<DT><EM>Set</EM></DT>
<DD>a set, set variable or set expression

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
    Set is constrained to be a set of integers between 1 and the size of
    the array ElementWeights. Weight is an integer domain variable which
    is constrained to the sum of the weights of Set's elements. The weight
    of a set element is determined by the array element in ElementWeights
    whose index corresponds to the set element.
</P><P>
    Changes to the set domain will affect the domain of Weight. There is currently
    no reverse propagation. This may change in a future release.
