   Attribute structure for set variables (and constants)

Fields

   off                 offset between set element and corresponding array index (integer)

   ucard               upper bound cardinality (integer)
   added               notification send-port for lower bound increases
   removed             notification send-port for upper bound decreases
   add                 suspension list woken when lower bound increases
   rem                 suspension list woken when upper bound decreases
   card                fd/ic variable for cardinality (see #/2)
