   ?Sterm              A set term.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   This constraint states that E belongs to the set term Sterm.  If E is
   not a known value the constraint is delayed.  It is activated as soon as
   E becomes a known value.  If Sterm is a ground set and E is known it
   checks if E belongs to Sterm.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if E cannot belong to Sterm.



Examples
   
[eclipse 4]: S `:: {}.. {1,2,3}, E in S.

E = E
S = S{{} .. {1, 2, 3}}

Delayed goals:
        E in_s S{{} .. {1, 2, 3}}
yes.

[eclipse 5]: S `:: {}.. {1,2,3}, 1 in S.

S = S{{1} .. {1, 2, 3}}
yes.
