<H2>Description</H2>
   This constraint states that E does not belong to the set term Sterm.  If
   E is not a known value the constraint is delayed.  It is activated as
   soon as E becomes a known value.  If Sterm is a ground set and E is
   known it checks if E does not belong to Sterm.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if E belongs to Sterm.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
