all_disjoint(?Lsets)

   Lsets is a list of set domain variables which are constrained to be
pairwise disjoint.



Arguments
   ?Lsets              List of set domain variables.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   Lsets is a list of set domain variables which are constrained to be
   pairwise disjoint.  Once the unconsistent domain bounds have been
   updated.  The predicate is a programming abstraction standing for
   conjunction of disjointness constraints.  The generated disjointness
   constraints are delayed.  They are activated each time a lower bound of
   one set domain involed is modified.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if some elements of Lsets are not set variables or if all the set
   variables can not be pairwise disjoint.



Examples
   
S `:: {}.. {1,3,5}, S1 `:: {1} .. {1,3,4}, S2 `::{3,4}..{3,4,5},
all_disjoint([S,S1,S2]).

S = S{{} .. {5}}
S1 = {1}
S2 = S2{{3, 4} .. {3, 4, 5}}

Delayed goals:
        S{{} .. {5}} dis_s S2{{3, 4} .. {3, 4, 5}}
yes.
