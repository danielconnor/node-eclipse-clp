?Sterm `= ?Sterm1

   Sterm and Sterm1 are equal.



Arguments
   ?Sterm              A ground set, a set domain variable or a set expression                containing set operators (union \/, intersection /\,                difference \).
   ?Sterm1             A ground set, a set domain variable or a set expression.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   This constraint states that the two set terms are equal.  It is
   activated whenever the upper or the lower bound of a set domain variable
   is updated.  When propagating set domain updates, the system reasons
   only over the upper and lower bound sets of values of the set domain and
   makes sure that these sets of values are consistent with those of other
   set domain variables.


   If this constraint is not solved, this predicate delays until it can be
   completely solved.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the two set terms have a different set value.



Examples
   
[eclipse 2]: S `:: {}.. {1,2,3}, [S1,S2] `:: {}..{3,4,5},
             S \/  S1 `= S2.

S = S{{} .. {3}}
S1 = S1{{} .. {3, 4, 5}}
S2 = S2{{} .. {3, 4, 5}}

Delayed goals:
        union_s(S{{} .. {3}}, S1{{} .. {3, 4, 5}},
S2{{} .. {3, 4, 5}})
yes.
