?Sterm `<> ?Sterm1

   Sterm and Sterm1 are disjoint.



Arguments
   ?Sterm              A set term.
   ?Sterm1             A set term.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   This constraint states that the set terms Sterm and Sterm1 have to be
   disjoint.  If both terms are known sets, it checks the empty
   intersection between them.  If either Sterm or Sterm1 is a known set,
   this constraint checks the empty intersection or disjointness and the
   unconsistent bounds of the set variables involved are modified.  If both
   terms contain set variables, the consistency of the domain bounds is
   checked and the constraint is delayed.  It is activated as soos as the
   lower bound of one set variable involved is modified.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Sterm can not be a subset of Sterm1.



Examples
   
[eclipse 3]: S `:: {}.. {1,2,3},S1 `:: {1} .. {1,2,3,4},
             S `<> S1.

S = S{{} .. {2, 3}}
S1 = S1{{1} .. {1, 2, 3, 4}}

Delayed goals:
        S{{} .. {2, 3}} dis_s S1{{1} .. {1, 2, 3, 4}}
yes.
