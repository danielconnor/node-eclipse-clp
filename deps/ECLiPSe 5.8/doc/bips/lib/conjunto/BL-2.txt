?Sterm `< ?Sterm1

   Sterm is a subset of Sterm1.



Arguments
   ?Sterm              A set term.
   ?Sterm1             A set term.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   This constraint states that the set term Sterm has to be a subset of the
   set term Sterm1.  If both terms are known sets, this constraint checks
   the inclusion.  If either Sterm or Sterm1 is a known set, this
   constraint checks the inclusion and the unconsistent bounds of the set
   variables involved are modified.  If both terms contain set variables
   their domain bounds are checked and the constraint is delayed.  It is
   activated as soon as the upper bound of Sterm1 or the lower bound of
   Sterm is modified.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Sterm can not be a subset of Sterm1.



Examples
   
[eclipse 3]: S `:: {1}.. {1,2,3,4}, S1 `:: {} .. {1,2,3},
 S `< S1.

S1 = S1{{1} .. {1, 2, 3}}
S = S{{1} .. {1, 2, 3}}

Delayed goals:
       S1{{1} .. {1, 2, 3}} sub_s S{{1} .. {1, 2, 3}}
yes.
