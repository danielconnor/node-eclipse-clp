glb(?S, ?Glb)

   S is a set domain variable and Glb is the lower bound of its domain.



Arguments
   ?S                  A set domain variable.
   ?Glb                A free variable or a ground set.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   Glb is the ground set corresponding to the lower bound of the domain of
   S. If Glb is a free variable, it is instanciated to the lower bound of
   the domain of S. If it is a ground set, it should be equal to the lower
   bound of the domain of S, otherwise it fails.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if S is not a set domain variable or if Glb is a ground set not
   equal to the lower bound of S domain.



Examples
   
[eclipse 9]: S `:: {}.. {1,2,3,5}, glb(S,Glb).

S = S{{} .. {1, 2, 3}}
Glb = {}
yes.
