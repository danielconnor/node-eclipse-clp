Description
   This predicate forces List to be the list of ordered elements associated
   to the ground set Svar.  List can be a free variable or a ground term.
   This predicate is convenient when iterations over set elements are
   required.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Svar is not ground or if List is ground and different from the
   computed list.



Examples
   
[eclipse 3]: S = {1,4,2,6,2,7}, set2list(S, L).

S = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
L = [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
yes.
