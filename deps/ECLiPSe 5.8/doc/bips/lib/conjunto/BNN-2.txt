?Svar `::  +Domain

   Terms in Svar have the set domain Domain.



Arguments
   ?SVar               A set variable or a list of set variables.
   +Domain             Lattice specified by its upper and lower bound Glb..Lub such                that Glb is a subset of Lub.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   The main purpose of this predicate is to create set domain variables.
   Domain has to be a closed set interval specified as Glb..Lub.  If SVar
   is already a set domain variable, its set domain will be updated
   according to the new domain; if it is instanciated, the predicate checks
   is the set value lies in the domain.  If the upper bound equals the
   lower bound the set variable describes a ground set.  Otherwise, if SVar
   is a free variable, it is converted to a set domain variable.  If SVar
   is a list, this will be performed for all its elements.  If Domain is
   free, it fails.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Domain is free, or if SVar cannot have the domain Domain.



Examples
   
[eclipse 3]: S `:: {}..{a,{2,3},c}.

S = S{{} .. {a, {2,3}, c}}
yes.
