Description
   This constraint states that E does not belong to the set term Sterm.  If
   E is not a known value the constraint is delayed.  It is activated as
   soon as E becomes a known value.  If Sterm is a ground set and E is
   known it checks if E does not belong to Sterm.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if E belongs to Sterm.
