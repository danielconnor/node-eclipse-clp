set_range(?Svar, ?Glb, ?Lub)

   Svar is a set domain variable and Glb and Lub are the respective lower
bound and upper bound of its domain.



Arguments
   ?Svar               A set domain variable.
   ?Glb                A free variable or a ground set.
   ?Lub                A free variable or a ground set.

Type
   library(conjunto)

Description
   This predicate computes the lower bound Glb and the upper bound Lub of
   the domain attached to the set variable Svar.  If Glb and/or Lub are
   ground, they should be equal to the respective bounds of the domain,
   otherwise it fails.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Svar is not a set domain variable or if one of the terms glb,
   Lub, can not be unified with the respective bounds of the domain of
   Svar.



Exceptions
     4 --- Var is not a domain variable.

Examples
   
[eclipse 7]: S `:: {} .. {1,2,3}, set_range(S, Glb, Lub).

S = S{{} .. {1, 2, 3}}
Glb = {}
Lub = {1, 2, 3}
yes.
