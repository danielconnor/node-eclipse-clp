Description
   Unifyes the weight of the term Var which should be of the form
   e(Val,Weight) with Wvar.  This predicate is convenient to select
   elements for the labeling of weighted sets.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Var is not of the form e(Val,Weight) or if Wvar is not
   unifyable with the weight.



Examples
   
[eclipse 12]: E = e(1,2), el_weight(E, W).

E = e(1, 2)
W = 2
