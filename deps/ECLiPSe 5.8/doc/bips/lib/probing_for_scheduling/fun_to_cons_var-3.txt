fun_to_cons_var(+CostFun, -ConsList, -CostVar)

   Convert a cost expression to a variable and a list of constraints, 
suitable to pass into probe_cstr_sched/7

Arguments
   CostFun             a cost function of the form accepted by probe_sched/5
   ConsList             a variable which will be instantiated to a list of constraints, 
suitable to pass into probe_cstr_sched/7
   CostVar             a variable constrained to take a value greater than or equal to 
the cost function

Type
   library(probing_for_scheduling)

Description

If the user needs to use probe_cstr_sched instead of probe_sched, this predicate can be used to convert the cost function to a list of constraints and a cost variable suitable for passing to probe_cstr_sched


Resatisfiable
   no

Examples
   
fun_to_cons_var(abs(X-10)+abs(Y-3),ConsList,Var)
