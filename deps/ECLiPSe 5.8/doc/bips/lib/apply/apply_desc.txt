lib(apply)


    This library defines the apply/2 predicate which constructs a goal
    from a term and a list of additional arguments:
    
    	?- P=plus(1), apply(P, [3,X]).
	P = plus(1)
	X = 4
	Yes (0.00s cpu)
    
    Loading this library also enables the syntax option var_functor_is_apply.
    This means that it is allowed to write terms with variables functors,
    which will be parsed as apply/2 terms which can the be executed.
    The above example can thus be written as:
    
    	?- P=plus(1), P(3,X).
	P = plus(1)
	X = 4
	Yes (0.00s cpu)
