weight(?Set, ++ElementWeights, ?Weight)

   According to the array of element weights, the weight of set Set is Weight

Arguments
   Set                 a set, set variable or set expression
   ElementWeights      an array (structure) of non-negative integers
   Weight              an integer variable or integer

Type
   library(fd_sets)

Description

    Set is constrained to be a set of integers between 1 and the size of
    the array ElementWeights. Weight is an integer domain variable which
    is constrained to the sum of the weights of Set's elements. The weight
    of a set element is determined by the array element in ElementWeights
    whose index corresponds to the set element.

    Changes to the set domain will affect the domain of Weight. There is currently
    no reverse propagation. This may change in a future release.
