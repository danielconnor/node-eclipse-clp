lib(java_vc)

 Module for the management of the Java Visualisation Client (VC) from ECLiPSe. The Java VC is an extensible, customisable, graphical visualisation tool for ECLiPSe implemented in Java. A new Java VC can be started using the predicate start_vc/1. While the Java VC is running, it will react automatically to the creation of viewables during ECLiPSe execution. For more information on how to declare and use viewables see the documentation for lib(viewable). The Java VC can be terminated from ECLiPSe using the predicate stop_vc/1.
