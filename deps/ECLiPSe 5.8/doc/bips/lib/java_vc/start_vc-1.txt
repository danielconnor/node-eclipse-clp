start_vc(-VisClientName)

   Start a new Java Visualisation Client

Arguments
   VisClientName       An atom; the name of the new visualisation client.

Type
   library(java_vc)

Description
This predicates starts a new Java Visualisation Client (VC). The VC survives backtracking over the start_vc/1 goal, and persists until it is explicitly terminated. VisClientName becomes instantiated to an atom which can be used when the VC is to be stopped. For start_vc to work correctly, ECLiPSe needs to know where to find the Java installation. To check whether this is so, use find_java/1. If the result of find_java/1 is not the root directory of a Java installation (at least version 1.2.2) then the behaviour of start_vc/1 prints an error message and fails.
