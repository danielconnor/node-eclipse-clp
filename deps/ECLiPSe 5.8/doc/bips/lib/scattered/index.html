<H2>Description</H2>

    The ECLiPSe compiler does not allow the clauses for static predicates
    being non-consecutive, i.e.  interleaved with clauses for other
    predicates.  The event 134 "procedure clauses are not consecutive" is
    raised in such a case.  The correct way to avoid this error is to use
    the discontiguous/1 declaration (ISO-Prolog compatible).
    <P>
    This library is therefore mostly obsolete!
    <P>
    It can still be useful for very old Prolog programs, which have been
    written for an interpreted system, and expect non-consecutive predicates
    to be generally allowed (without declaration).  It is enough to load
    this library before compiling such a source file.  It redefines the
    handler for the event 134 in such a way that the procedures with
    non-consecutive clauses are recompiled in one chunk after encountering
    the end of the file. 
    <P>
    When not compiling from a file, the non-consecutive clauses have to be
    declared using the directive scattered/1.  This declaration has to
    precede any clauses of the predicate. 
    <PRE>
    :- lib(scattered).
    :- scattered p/3, q/1.
    </PRE>
    Note that this applies to predicates whose clauses are
    non-consecutive, but in a single file.  Predicates that are spread
    over multiple files still have to be declared as dynamic.
