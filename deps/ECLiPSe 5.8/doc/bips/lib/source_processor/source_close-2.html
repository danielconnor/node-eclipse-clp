<H2>Description</H2>
This is used to close an ECLiPSe source file that was
    previously opened with source_open/3.  It is possible to close
    before the end of the source is reached. Nesting of included
    files is properly handled.
    <P>
    OptionList can contain the following:
    <DL>
    <DT>keep_modules</DT>
    	<DD>keep the modules that have been created implicitly during
	source processing (by default they are erased to restore the
	original state)</DD>
    </DL>
