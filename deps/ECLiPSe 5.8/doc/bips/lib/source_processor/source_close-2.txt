Description
This is used to close an ECLiPSe source file that was
    previously opened with source_open/3.  It is possible to close
    before the end of the source is reached. Nesting of included
    files is properly handled.
    
    OptionList can contain the following:
    
    keep_modules
    	keep the modules that have been created implicitly during
	source processing (by default they are erased to restore the
	original state)
