union(+List1, +List2, ?Union)

   Succeeds if Union is the list which contains the union of elements in List1
and those in List2.



Arguments
   +List1              List.
   +List2              List.
   ?Union              List or variable.

Type
   library(lists)

Description
   Used to create the list of elements in List1 and not in List2, added to
   those in List2.

   The definition of this Prolog library predicate is:

union([], L, L).
union([Head|L1tail], L2, L3) :-
        memberchk(Head, L2),
        !,
        union(L1tail, L2, L3).
union([Head|L1tail], L2, [Head|L3tail]) :-
        union(L1tail, L2, L3tail).

   This predicate does not perform any type testing functions.

   This predicate works properly for set operations only, so repeated
   elements and variable elements should not be used.
	

Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Union does not unify with the list which contains the union of
   elements in List1 and those in List2.



Examples
   
Success:
      union([1,2,3],[1,3],L).     (gives L=[2,1,3]).

Fail:
      union([1,2,3,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]).  % repeated elements
