member(?Term, ?List)

   Succeeds if Term unifies with a member of the list List.



Arguments
   ?Term               Prolog term.
   ?List               List or variable.

Type
   library(lists)

Description
   Tries to unify Term with an element of the list List.

   If Term is a variable and List is a list, all the members of the list
   List are found on backtracking.

   If List is not instantiated, member/2 binds List to a new partial list
   containing the element Term.

   The definition of this Prolog library predicate is:

       member(X,[X|_]).
       member(X,[Y|T]) :- member(X,T).

   This predicate does not perform any type testing functions.
	

Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Term does not unify with a member of the list List.



Examples
   
Success:
      member(q,[1,2,3,p,q,r]).
      member(q,[1,2,F]).      (gives F=q).
      member(X,[1,X]).        (gives X=1; X=_g118).
      member(X,[2,I]).        (gives X=2 I=_g114; X=_g94 I=_g94).
      member(1,L).            (gives L=[1|_g64];
                                     L=[_g62,1|_g68] etc).

Fail:
      member(4,[1,2,3]).
