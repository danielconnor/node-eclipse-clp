Description
   checklist/3 succeeds if for every element of List, the invocation of
   Pred with one aditional argument which is this element succeeds.

   The definition of this Prolog library predicate is:

:- tool(checklist/3, checklist_body/4).

checklist_body(_, [], _).
checklist_body(Pred, [Head|Tail], M) :-
    Pred =.. PL,
    append(PL, [Head], NewPred),
    Call =.. NewPred,
    call(Call, M),
    checklist_body(Pred, Tail, M).

   This predicate does not perform any type testing functions.
	

Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if at least for one element of List the invocation of Pred with
   this additional argument fails.



Examples
   
Success:
  checklist(integer, [1, 3, 5]).
  checklist(spy, [var/1, functor/3]).

Fail:
  checklist(current_op(_, _), [+, -, =]).
  (fails because the precedence of = does not match that of +)
