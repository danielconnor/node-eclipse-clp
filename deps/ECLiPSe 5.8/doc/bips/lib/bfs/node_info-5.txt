BfsInstance:node_info(+Var, ?Lo, ?Hi, ?Val, ?RC)

   Get or set node bounds and solution information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A solver problem variable for solver the associated with BfsInstance
   Lo                  Lower bound for Var (number)
   Hi                  Upper bound for Var (number)
   Val                 Solution value for Var (number)
   RC                  Reduced cost for Var (number)

Type
   library(bfs)

Description

   Retrieve or update bounds and solution information for an
   individual solver problem variable Var for the current open node of
   the search tree associated with the bfs instance BfsInstance. If Var
   was not already a problem variable for BfsInstance it will now be
   considered one. If reduced costs are available in problems
   involving eplex instances supplying these to the bfs solver can lead
   to improved pruning.
