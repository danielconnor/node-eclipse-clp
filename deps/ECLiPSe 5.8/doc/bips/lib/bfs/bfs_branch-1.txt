BfsInstance:bfs_branch(+Branch)

   Post a branching constraint to the bfs instance BfsInstance.

Arguments
   Branch              Prolog term

Type
   library(bfs)

Description

   Post a new branching constraint Branch to the bfs instance
   BfsInstance. The constraint will be used to create a new child node
   of the current open node in the search tree for BfsInstance.
   Branch may be any prolog term, but clearly should be an
   appropriate constraint for the node relaxation solver associated with
   BfsInstance.
