BfsInstance:var_get(+Var, ++What, -Value)

   Obtain information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A solver problem variable for the solver associated with BfsInstance
   What                Specification for information wanted (atom)
   Value               Returned value of What

Type
   library(bfs)

Description

   Retrieve information about solver results related to a particular
   variable, for the bfs instance BfsInstance. Fails if Var is not a
   problem variable for BfsInstance. What can take one of the following
   values: 


    optimal_val
    Returns the floating-point solution for variable Var.


    node_val
    Returns the floating-point solution for variable Var for the
    current node in the search tree of this instance.


    type
    Returns the type real or integer of Var in this instance.


Exceptions
