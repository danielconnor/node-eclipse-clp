lib(bfs)


   This library lets you use customisable branch-and-bound search. It
   is primarily intended for use with the colgen library in implementing
   branch-and-price algorithms, but can be used with arbitrary
   user-defined node solution, separation and selection goals.
   When application specific methods are not required for node
   separation and/or selection the use of built-in depth-first
   and best-first node selection, and branching on most fractional
   variable or generalised upper bound constraint may be specified.
   When the relaxed problem to be solved at a node involves an eplex
   instance branching may additionally be specified by built-in
   objective coefficient, estimate- or lower-bounding based methods,
   and best-estimate node selection may be used.
