bfs_instance(++BfsInstance)

   Initialises the bfs instance BfsInstance.

Arguments
   BfsInstance         Bfs instance name (atom)

Type
   library(bfs)

Description
  
  Initialises the bfs instance BfsInstance. A bfs instance is an
  instance of the best first search solver, with which node
  relaxation and separation solvers can be associated and used to
  optimise the problem constraints posted to the relaxed node solver
  with respect to its objective using a specified node ordering scheme.
  In particular best-first and best-estimate search schemes are
  supported and application-specific schemes may be easily defined by
  the user.
  
  If BfsInstance is not an already existing bfs instance, a new bfs
  instance will be created and initialised. If it is an existing bfs
  instance, and it is not currently being used (having no associated
  solvers), it is effectively reinitialised. Otherwise, the predicate
  aborts with an error. Note that a bfs instance is a module, and each
  bfs instance can be associated with at most one relaxation and one
  separation solver at any time and vice versa.
