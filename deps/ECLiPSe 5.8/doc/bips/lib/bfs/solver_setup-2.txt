BfsInstance:solver_setup(+OptSense, +Solver)

   Setup a bfs solver tree for bfs instance BfsInstance.

Arguments
   OptSense            Optimisation direction: min or max
   Solver              Node relaxation solver

Type
   library(bfs)

Description

  Setup a new solver tree for the bfs instance BfsInstance. The tree
  will be associated with BfsInstance; BfsInstance must not already
  have a solver tree associated with it. Once the solver tree is setup,
  it can be optimised via solve/1.

  This is a simplified version of solver_setup/3, it is equivalent to
  calling solver_setup/3 with the following default options:

       solver_setup(OptSense, Solver, [])
