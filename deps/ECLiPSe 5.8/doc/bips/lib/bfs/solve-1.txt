BfsInstance:solve(-Cost)

   Optimise the problem associated with BfsInstance.

Arguments
   Cost                The optimal solution cost of the problem associated with BfsInstance

Type
   library(bfs)

Description

   A solver setup with solver_setup/2 or solver_setup/3 is triggered
   using this predicate.

   The node relaxation and separation solvers are applied to the next
   selected node of the problem represented by Handle repeatedly until
   no more open nodes remain. The criteria for node selection order
   depends on the options given to solver_setup/2,3.  solve/1 fails if
   there is no solution or succeeds if an optimal solution is found,
   returning the solution's cost in Cost.  After a success, various
   solution information and statistics can be retrieved using get/2,
   var_get/3 and statistics/0.


Fail Conditions
   No solution exists satisfying the global feasibility conditions.
