Declare Ints as integers in BfsInstance.

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   The variable or list of variables Ints will be considered integers
   when solving the problem associated with BfsInstance. Note that
   this does not mean that they will be treated as integers by the
   specified node relaxation solver, rather that they will be considered
   as candidates for branching decisions in nodes where their solution
   value is not integral (to within a tolerance parameter set in the
   options list of BfsInstance:solver_setup/3). The predefined
   node separation schemes will branch on these variables. User-defined
   node separation predicates may access the fractional variables
   at the current node via a call to BfsInstance:get/2
