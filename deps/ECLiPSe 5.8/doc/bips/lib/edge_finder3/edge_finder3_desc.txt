lib(edge_finder3)

   
    This library implements the cubic edge-finder algorithm for the
    disjunctive and cumulative scheduling constraints for the FD solver.
    It provides the strongest propagation of the three libraries for
    cumulative constraints: cumulative, edge_finder and edge_finder3.
    It is also computationally the most expensive.

    Note that the same predicates are implemented in both edge_finder and
    edge_finder3 libraries.
