posted_params(-NameValuePairs)

   Returns the parameters posted to the CGI script

Type
   library(cgi)

Description
Returns a list of Name=Value pairs, where Name is an atom
    and Value is a string, representing the information that was posted to
    the CGI script. Both POST and GET methods are supported.
    
    If there is a problem, the predicate fails. In that case, the caller should
    retrieve an error message using get_error_output/1 and present it to the
    user, e.g. by embedding it into the generated html page.
    

Fail Conditions
   There was a problem obtaining the parameters from the environment
