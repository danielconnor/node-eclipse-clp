get_from_heap(+OldHeap, ?Key, ?Datum, -NewHeap)

   returns the Key-Datum pair in OldHeap with the smallest Key

Type
   library(heaps)

Description

    returns the Key-Datum pair in OldHeap with the smallest Key, and
    also a New Heap which is the Old Heap with that pair deleted.
    The easy part is picking off the smallest element.  The hard part
    is repairing the heap structure.  repair_heap/4 takes a pair of
    heaps and returns a new heap built from their elements, and the
    position number of the gap in the new tree.  Note that repair_heap
    is *not* tail-recursive.
