takes a list of Key-Datum pairs and forms them into a heap
<H2>Description</H2>

    takes a list of Key-Datum pairs (such as keysort could be used to
    sort) and forms them into a heap.  We could do that a wee bit
    faster by keysorting the list and building the tree directly, but
    this algorithm makes it obvious that the result is a heap, and
    could be adapted for use when the ordering predicate is not @<
    and hence keysort is inapplicable.
