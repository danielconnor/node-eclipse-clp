returns the current set of Key-Datum pairs in the Heap as a List.
<H2>Description</H2>

    returns the current set of Key-Datum pairs in the Heap as a
    List, sorted into ascending order of Keys.  This is included
    simply because I think every data structure foo ought to have
    a foo_to_list and list_to_foo relation (where, of course, it
    makes sense!) so that conversion between arbitrary data
    structures is as easy as possible.  This predicate is basically
    just a merge sort, where we can exploit the fact that the tops
    of the subtrees are smaller than their descendants.
