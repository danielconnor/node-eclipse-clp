deletemin(?Var, +List, -Rest)

   Select from List the variable Var which has the smallest lower domain bound,
and return the rest of the list.



Arguments
   -Var                A variable.
   -Rest               A term unifying with a list of domain variables or integers.
   +List               A list of domain variables or integers.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This predicate is used in labeling procedures.  Especially when labeling
   start times in scheduling problems, it is often a good strategy to start
   with the earliest possible tasks, because fixing those will cause useful
   bounds propagation on the start times of the other tasks. This predicate
   selects from a list the variable with the smallest lower bound. Numbers
   are treated as if they were variables with singleton domains.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if List is empty.



Examples
   
   start_time_labeling([]) :- !.
   start_time_labeling(Vars) :-
        deletemin(X, Vars, Rest),
	indomain(X),
	start_time_labeling(Rest).
