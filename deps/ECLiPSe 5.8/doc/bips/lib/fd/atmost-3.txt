Description
   If List is a list of domain variables and/or integers, this constraint
   takes care that at most N element of this list have the value V. As soon
   as some domain variable from the list is updated, this constraint is
   woken and it checks if the constraint is still satisfiable and if so, if
   it is already satisfied or not.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if more than N elements of List are instantiated to V.
