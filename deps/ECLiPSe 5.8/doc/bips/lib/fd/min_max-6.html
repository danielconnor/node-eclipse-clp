<H2>Description</H2>
   If C is a linear term, a solution of the goal Goal is found that
   minimizes the value of C. If C is a list of linear terms, the returned
   solution minimizes the maximum value of terms in the list.  The solution
   is found using the branch and bound method; as soon as a partial
   solution is found that is worse than a previous solution, the search is
   abandoned and a new solution is searched for.  The starting assumption
   is that the value to minimize is less than Upper and that any value less
   than Lower can be considered as a final solution.  Moreover, solutions
   whose minimized values are closer than Percent % are considered equal.
   Every time a new better solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its
   default handler prints the current cost.

<P>
   If Timeout is not zero, the predicate will stop after Timeout seconds
   and report the best solution it has found so far.  Calls with specified
   Timeout cannot be nested.

<P>
   This predicate is to be used for optimization problems when the whole
   search space is too large or when a suboptimal solution is sufficient.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if there is no solution to Goal.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
