<H1>deletemin(?Var, +List, -Rest)</H1>
Select from List the variable Var which has the smallest lower domain bound,
and return the rest of the list.


<DL>
<DT><EM>-Var</EM></DT>
<DD>A variable.
</DD>
<DT><EM>-Rest</EM></DT>
<DD>A term unifying with a list of domain variables or integers.
</DD>
<DT><EM>+List</EM></DT>
<DD>A list of domain variables or integers.

<H2>Description</H2>
   This predicate is used in labeling procedures.  Especially when labeling
   start times in scheduling problems, it is often a good strategy to start
   with the earliest possible tasks, because fixing those will cause useful
   bounds propagation on the start times of the other tasks. This predicate
   selects from a list the variable with the smallest lower bound. Numbers
   are treated as if they were variables with singleton domains.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if List is empty.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.

        deletemin(X, Vars, Rest),
