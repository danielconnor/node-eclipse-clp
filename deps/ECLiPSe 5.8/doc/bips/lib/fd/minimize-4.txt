minimize(+Goal, ?Template, ?Solution, ?C)

   Find the solution of Goal that minimizes C,
and unify the minimized Template with Solution.



Arguments
   +Goal               A callable term.
   ?Template           A term containing all or some of Goal's variables
   ?Solution           Term to be unified with the minimized Template
   ?C                  A linear term or a list of linear terms.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   A solution of the goal Goal is found that minimizes the value of C. 
   The solution is found using the branch and bound method.  Whenever
   a better solution is found, the upper cost bound is tightened and
   the search for a better solution continues.  Every time a new
   better solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default
   handler prints the current cost.


   Solutions will be unified with a copy of Template where the variables
   are replaced with their minimized values. Typically, the Template will
   contain all or a subset of Goal's variables.


   minimize/2 can be written in terms of minimize/4 as follows:



	minimize(Goal, Cost) :-
	    minimize(Goal, Goal, Goal, Cost).



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if there is no solution to Goal.



Examples
   
    % Find the minimal C and bind X to the corresponding value
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), X, X, C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = 3
    C = 0
    yes.

    % Find the minimal C and don't bind anything
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), [], [], C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = X{[1..3]}
    C = C{[0..2]}

    Delayed goals:
	    -3 + X{[1..3]} + C{[0..2]}#=0
    yes.

    % Find the minimal C and return it in MinC. Don't bind X or C.
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), C, MinC, C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = X{[1..3]}
    MinC = 0
    C = C{[0..2]}

    Delayed goals:
	    -3 + X{[1..3]} + C{[0..2]}#=0
    yes.
