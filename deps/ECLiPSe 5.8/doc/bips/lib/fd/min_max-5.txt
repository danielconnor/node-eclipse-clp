min_max(?Goal, ?C, +Lower, +Upper, +Percent)

   Find the solution of Goal that minimizes the maximum of elements of C,
within the bounds set by Lower,Upper and Percent.



Arguments
   ?Goal               A callable term.
   ?C                  A linear term or a list of linear terms.
   +Lower              An integer.
   +Upper              An integer.
   +Percent            An integer.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   If C is a linear term, a solution of the goal Goal is found that
   minimizes the value of C. If C is a list of linear terms, the returned
   solution minimizes the maximum value of terms in the list.  The solution
   is found using the branch and bound method; as soon as a partial
   solution is found that is worse than a previous solution, the search is
   abandoned and a new solution is searched for.  The starting assumption
   is that the value to minimize is less than Upper and that any value less
   than Lower can be considered as a final solution.  Moreover, solutions
   whose minimized values are closer than Percent % are considered equal.
   Every time a new better solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its
   default handler prints the current cost.


   This predicate is to be used for optimization problems when the whole
   search space is too large or when a suboptimal solution is sufficient.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if there is no solution to Goal.
