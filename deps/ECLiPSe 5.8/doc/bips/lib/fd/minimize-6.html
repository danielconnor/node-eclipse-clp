<H2>Description</H2>
   A solution of the goal Goal is found that minimizes the value of C. 
   The solution is found using the branch and bound method.  Whenever
   a better solution is found, the upper cost bound is tightened and
   the search for a better solution continues.

<P>
   The starting assumption is that the value to minimize is less than
   Upper and that any value less than Lower can be considered as a
   solution.  Moreover, solutions whose minimized values are closer
   than Percent % are considered equal.  Every time a new better
   solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default handler
   prints the current cost.

<P>
   If Timeout is not zero, the predicate will stop after Timeout seconds
   and report the best solution it has found so far.  Calls with specified
   Timeout cannot be nested.

<P>
   This predicate is to be used for optimization problems when the whole
   search space is too large or when a suboptimal solution is sufficient.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Goal fails.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
