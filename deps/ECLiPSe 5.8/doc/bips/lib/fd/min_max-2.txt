min_max(?Goal, ?C)

   Find the solution of Goal that minimizes the maximum of elements of C.



Arguments
   +Goal               A callable term.
   ?C                  A linear term or a list of linear terms.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   If C is a linear term, a solution of the goal Goal is found that
   minimizes the value of C. If C is a list of linear terms, the returned
   solution minimizes the maximum value of terms in the list.  The solution
   is found using the branch and bound method; as soon as a partial
   solution is found that is worse than a previous solution, the search is
   abandoned and a new solution is searched for.  Every time a new better
   solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default handler prints
   the current cost.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if there is no solution to Goal.
