?C1 #\/ ?C2

   The constraint expression C1 or the constraint expression C2 is true.



Arguments
   ?C1                 An arithmetic constraint expression.
   ?C2                 An arithmetic constraint expression.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This constraint states that at least one of the two constraint
   expressions C1, C2 must be true.  If this is already the case, it simply
   succeeds.  Otherwise it is suspended and after each domain change that
   may cause one of the two expressions to fail, it is woken and
   re-evaluated.  If one of the two expressions is false, the other is
   imposed as a constraint, i.e.  it acts as disjunctive constraint.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if both C1 and C2 are false.
