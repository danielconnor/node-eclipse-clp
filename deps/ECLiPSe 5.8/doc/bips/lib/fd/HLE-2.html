<H2>Description</H2>
   This constraint states that the linear term X is less than or equal to
   the linear term Y. It is activated whenever the maximum or minimum of a
   domain variable is updated that might require updating other domains.
   When propagating domain updates, the system takes into account only
   maximum and minimum values of the whole domain and makes sure that these
   values are consistent with those of other domain variables.

<P>
   If one of the arguments is a non-linear polynomial, this predicate
   delays until it becomes linear.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if X is greater than Y.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
