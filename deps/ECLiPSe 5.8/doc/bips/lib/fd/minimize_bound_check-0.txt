minimize_bound_check

   If within a minimization, force a check of the cost variable against
the cost bound, which may lead to earlier failure.



Arguments

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This predicate can be used within a goal that is being minimized
   using minimize/2 or any of its variants. If used in other contexts
   it has no effect just succeeds.


   The behaviour of minimize/2 is such that the cost bound is tightened
   whenever a better solution is found, but this tightening does not
   trigger an automatic check.  It can therefore be advantageous and
   lead to earlier failure when minimize_bound_check/0 is called after
   every labeling step.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the current cost cannot become smaller that the cost bound.



Examples
   
    labeling([]).
    labeling([X|Xs]) :-
	% do the check urgently, before any propagation happens
	call_priority((indomain(X), minimize_bound_check), 2),
	labeling(Xs).
