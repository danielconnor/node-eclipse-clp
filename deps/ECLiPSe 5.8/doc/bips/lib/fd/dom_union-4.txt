dom_union(+Dom1, +Dom2, -DomUnion, -Size)

   The domain DomUnion is the union of domains Dom1 and Dom2 and Size is the
number of its elements.



Arguments
   +Dom1               A finite domain.
   +Dom2               A finite domain.
   -DomUnion           A variable.
   -Size               A variable.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   The domain DomUnion is the union of domains Dom1 and Dom2 and Size is
   the number of its elements.


   Note that the main use of the predicate is to yield the most specific
   generalisation of two domains, in the usual cases the domains become
   smaller, not bigger.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the union is empty.
