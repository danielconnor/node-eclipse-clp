sorted_list_to_dom(+List, -Dom)

   Convert a sorted list of atomic terms and integer intervals into a domain
Dom.



Arguments
   +List               A sorted list of atomic terms and integer interval.
   -Dom                Variable.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   Convert a sorted list of atomic terms and integer intervals into a
   domain Dom.  List is assumed to be in the correct order and format for a
   finite domain.  If it is not, the program will not work correctly.  The
   purpose of this predicate is to quickly convert small lists to domains.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- List is not ground.
     5 --- List contains an element which is neither atomic nor an    integer interval.
     6 --- The size of the resulting domain is too large.
     6 --- The lower bound of an integer interval is greater than its    upper bound.
