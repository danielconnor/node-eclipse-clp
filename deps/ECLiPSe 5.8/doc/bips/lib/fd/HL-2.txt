?X #< ?Y

   The linear term X is less than the linear term Y.



Arguments
   ?X                  A linear term.
   ?Y                  A linear term.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This constraint states that the linear term X is less than the linear
   term Y. It is activated whenever the maximum or minimum of a domain
   variable is updated that might require updating other domains.  When
   propagating domain updates, the system takes into account only maximum
   and minimum values of the whole domain and makes sure that these values
   are consistent with those of other domain variables.


   If one of the arguments is a non-linear polynomial, this predicate
   delays until it becomes linear.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if X is not less than Y.
