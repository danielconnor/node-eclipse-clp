minimize(?Goal, ?C)

   Find the solution of Goal that minimizes C.



Arguments
   +Goal               A callable term.
   ?C                  A linear term.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   A solution of the goal Goal is found that minimizes the value of C. 
   The solution is found using the branch and bound method.  Whenever
   a better solution is found, the upper cost bound is tightened and
   the search for a better solution continues.  Every time a new
   better solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default
   handler prints the current cost.


   Note:  Operationally, the difference with min_max/2 is that, after
   finding a solution, the search is not abandoned and restarted, but
   continued with a tightened cost bound.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if there is no solution to Goal.
