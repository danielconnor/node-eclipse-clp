deleteff(?Var, +List, -Rest)

   Select from List the variable Var which has the smallest domain and return
the rest of the list.



Arguments
   -Var                A variable.
   -Rest               A term unifying with a list of domain variables or integers.
   +List               A list of domain variables or integers.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This predicate is used in the labeling procedures.  When we look for the
   instantiation of a list of domain variables which is consistent with a
   set of constraints, it is better to start with instantiations which are
   most likely to fail, because this will cut down the size of the search
   space considerably.


   The predicate deleteff/3 selects the variable with the smallest
   domain. If there are several variables with the same domain size,
   the leftmost one in the list is taken. Constants are treated like
   variables of domain size one. The list Rest is the same as List
   except that the selected element is missing. In particular, any
   existing list order is preserved.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if List is nil.
