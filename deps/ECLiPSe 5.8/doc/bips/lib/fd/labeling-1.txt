labeling(+Vars)

   Instantiate all variables in a list to values in their domain

Arguments
   Vars                List of variables or ground terms.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
    This predicate instantiates all variables in a list to values in their
    domain, using the indomain/1 predicate. It is simply defined as:

        labeling([]).
        labeling([Var|Rest]) :-
            indomain(Var),
            labeling(Rest).

    The list can contain ground terms, i.e. variables that are already
    instantated. These are just skipped, in other words, they are
    considered as variables with a single value in their domain.
    

Resatisfiable
   Yes
