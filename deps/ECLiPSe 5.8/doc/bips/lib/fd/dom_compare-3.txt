dom_compare(?Res, +Dom1, +Dom2)

   Res is the result of the comparison of the domains Dom1 and Dom2.



Arguments
   ?Res                Atom or variable.
   +Dom1               A finite domain.
   +Dom2               A finite domain.

Description
   Works like compare/3 for terms.  Res is unified with


  * = iff Dom1 is equal to Dom2,


  * < iff Dom1 is a proper subset of Dom2,


  * > iff Dom2 is a proper subset of Dom1.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if neither domain is a subset of the other one.
