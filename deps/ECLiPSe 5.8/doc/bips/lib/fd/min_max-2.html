<H1>min_max(?Goal, ?C)</H1>
Find the solution of Goal that minimizes the maximum of elements of C.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>A callable term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?C</EM></DT>
<DD>A linear term or a list of linear terms.

</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   If C is a linear term, a solution of the goal Goal is found that
   minimizes the value of C. If C is a list of linear terms, the returned
   solution minimizes the maximum value of terms in the list.  The solution
   is found using the branch and bound method; as soon as a partial
   solution is found that is worse than a previous solution, the search is
   abandoned and a new solution is searched for.  Every time a new better
   solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default handler prints
   the current cost.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if there is no solution to Goal.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
