<H2>Description</H2>
   This is the most general version of the minimize predicate with all
   options.

<P>
   A solution of the goal Goal is found that minimizes the value of C. 
   The solution is found using the branch and bound method.  Whenever
   a better solution is found, the upper cost bound is tightened and
   the search for a better solution continues.

<P>
   The starting assumption is that the value to minimize is less than
   Upper and that any value less than Lower can be considered as a
   final solution.  Moreover, solutions whose minimized values are
   closer than Percent % are considered equal.  Every time a new
   better solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default
   handler prints the current cost.

<P>
   Solutions will be unified with a copy of Template where the variables
   are replaced with their minimized values. Typically, the Template will
   contain all or a subset of Goal's variables.

<P>
   If Timeout is not zero, the predicate will stop after Timeout seconds
   and report the best solution it has found so far.  Calls with specified
   Timeout cannot be nested.

<P>
   All other variants of minimize can be written in terms of minimize/9, eg.

<P>
<PRE>
	minimize(Goal, Cost) :-
	    minint(Min), maxint(Max),
	    minimize(Goal, Goal, Goal, Cost, Min, Max, 0, 0).
</PRE>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if there is no solution to Goal.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
    % Find the minimal C and bind X to the corresponding value
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), X, X, C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = 3
    C = 0
    yes.

    % Find the minimal C and don't bind anything
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), [], [], C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = X{[1..3]}
    C = C{[0..2]}

    Delayed goals:
	    -3 + X{[1..3]} + C{[0..2]}#=0
    yes.

    % Find the minimal C and return it in MinC. Don't bind X or C.
    [eclipse]: X::1..3, C #= 3-X, minimize(indomain(X), C, MinC, C).
    Found a solution with cost 2
    Found a solution with cost 1
    Found a solution with cost 0
    X = X{[1..3]}
    MinC = 0
    C = C{[0..2]}

    Delayed goals:
	    -3 + X{[1..3]} + C{[0..2]}#=0
    yes.
