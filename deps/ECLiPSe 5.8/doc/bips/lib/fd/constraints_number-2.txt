constraints_number(?Var, ?N)

   The number of constraints and suspended goals associated with the variable
Var is N.



Arguments
   ?Var                Prolog term
   ?N                  Variable or integer

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   N is the number of constraints and suspended goals currently attached to
   the variable Var.  Note that this number may not correspond to the exact
   number of different constraints attached to Var, as goals in different
   suspending lists are counted separately.  This predicate is often used
   when looking for the most or least constrained variable from a set of
   domain variables.  If Var is instantiated, N is bound to a very large
   integer, if Var is a free variable, N is zero.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.
