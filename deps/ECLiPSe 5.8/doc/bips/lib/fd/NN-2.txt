?Vars ::  ?Domain

   Terms in Vars have the domain Domain.



Arguments
   ?Vars               A variable or a list of variables.
   +Domain             Variable, integer, integer interval or a list of integers                and integer intervals.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   The main purpose of this predicate is to create domain variables.
   Domain can be a closed integer interval denoted as Min..Max, or a sorted
   list of integer intervals and/or elements.  If Vars is already a domain
   variable, its domain will be updated according to the new domain; if it
   is instantiated, the predicate checks if the value lies in the domain.
   Otherwise, if Vars is a free variable, it is converted to a domain
   variable.  If Vars is a list, this will be performed for all its
   elements.


   If Vars is a domain variable and Domain is free, it is bound to the
   domain of the variable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Vars cannot have the domain Domain.
