dvar_replace(+DVar, +NewDom)

   Change the domain of the domain variable DVar to NewDom without propagating
the changes.



Arguments
   +DVar               A domain variable.
   +NewDom             A finite domain.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   If the size of the domain NewDom is 0, the predicate fails.  If the size
   of the new domain is 1, DVar is given this singleton domain.  Otherwise,
   if the size of the new domain is smaller than the size of the domain
   variable's domain, the domain of DVar is replaced by NewDom, but no
   suspensions are passed to the waking scheduler.


   This predicate is useful for local consistency checks.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.
