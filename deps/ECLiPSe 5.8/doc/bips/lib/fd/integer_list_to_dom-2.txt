integer_list_to_dom(+List, -Dom)

   Convert a sorted list of integers and integer intervals into a domain Dom.



Arguments
   +List               A list of integers and integer interval.
   -Dom                Variable.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   Convert a sorted list of integers and integer intervals into a domain
   Dom.  List must be sorted and integers must not overlap with intervals.
   Note that using sort/2 on a list of integers and intervals does not
   produce correct results because intervals are considered compound terms
   and thus sorted after all integers.  This predicate converts a list of
   successive integers into an interval and/or merges it with adjacent
   intervals.  Typically, it will be used to convert a sorted list of
   integers into a list of intervals and an appropriate domain.  If the
   list is already known to contain the right intervals, it is quicker to
   use sorted_list_to_dom/2.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- List is not ground.
     5 --- List contains an element which is neither integer nor an    integer interval.
     6 --- The size of the resulting domain is too large.
     6 --- The list is not sorted properly.
