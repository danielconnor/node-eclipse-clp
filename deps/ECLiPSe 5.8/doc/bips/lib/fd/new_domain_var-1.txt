new_domain_var(-Var)

   A user hook predicate which is called whenever a variable obtains a default
domain from the solver.



Arguments
   -Var                A variable.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   This predicate is a simple hook to notify about free variables being
   converted into domain variables.  Whenever the finite domain solver
   assigns a free variable a domain, it invokes this predicate in the
   module fd_domain with the variable as argument.  To use the mechanism,
   it is necessary to recompile this predicate in the module fd_domain.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
   [eclipse 22]: compile(user, fd_domain).
   new_domain_var(X) :- printf("new domain variable created: %mw%n", [X]).
   user       compiled traceable 88 bytes in 0.00 seconds
   yes.
   [eclipse 23]: X+Y #> T.
   new domain variable created: X[-10000000..10000000]
   new domain variable created: Y[-10000000..10000000]
   new domain variable created: T[-10000000..10000000]
