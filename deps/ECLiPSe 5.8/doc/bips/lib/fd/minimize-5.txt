minimize(?Goal, ?C, +Lower, +Upper, +Percent)

   Find the solution of Goal that minimizes C, within the bounds set by Lower,
Upper and Percent.



Arguments
   ?Goal               A callable term.
   ?C                  A linear term.
   +Lower              Integer.
   +Upper              Integer.
   +Percent            Integer.

Type
   library(fd)

Description
   A solution of the goal Goal is found that minimizes the value of C. 
   The solution is found using the branch and bound method.  Whenever
   a better solution is found, the upper cost bound is tightened and
   the search for a better solution continues.


   The starting assumption is that the value to minimize is less than
   Upper and that any value less than Lower can be considered as a
   solution.  Moreover, solutions whose minimized values are closer
   than Percent % are considered equal.  Every time a new better
   solution is found, the event 280 is raised, its default handler
   prints the current cost.


   This predicate is to be used for optimization problems when the whole
   search space is too large or when a suboptimal solution is sufficient.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Goal fails.
