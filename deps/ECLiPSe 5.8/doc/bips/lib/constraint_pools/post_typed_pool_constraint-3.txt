post_typed_pool_constraint(+Pool, +Type, +Constraint)

   Stores the term Constraint in Pool's constraint store as type Type

Arguments
   Pool                Atom
   Type                Integer
   Constraint          Callable Term

Type

Description

    Stores the term Constraint in Pool's constraint store as type Type.
    Constraint is not interpreted in any way, it is just stored in order
    to be retrieved later using one of the retrieval predicates.
    

Examples
       ?- create_constraint_pool(p, 3, []).
    Yes (0.09s cpu)

    ?- post_typed_pool_constraint(p, 1, foo(one)),
	    post_typed_pool_constraint(p, 2, bar(two)),
	    post_typed_pool_constraint(p, 1, baz(three)),
	    get_typed_pool_constraints(p, 1, C1),
	    get_typed_pool_constraints(p, 2, C2).
	    get_typed_pool_constraints(p, 3, C3).

    C1 = [baz(three), foo(one)]
    C2 = [bar(two)]
    C3 = []
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
