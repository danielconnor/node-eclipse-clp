lib(constraint_pools)


    This library contains support for constraint pools. Constraint
    pools are a way to have several instances of a constraint solver.

    A constraint pool is an Eclipse module. It exports a number of
    predicates (often constraint predicates) which are specified when
    the pool is created. The constraint pool does not implement these
    predicates (constraints) itself, but simply forwards every predicate
    call, or stores the calls, annotated with the pool name.
