<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
    This will pretty-print the given source file, annotated with the
    values of code coverage counters. The resulting .html file will be
    placed in a sub-directory called 'coverage', relative to File.
    See result/2 for options to modify the output.
</P><P>
    This predicate only makes sense if File has previously been compiled
    in coverage mode (using coverage:ccompile/1,2), and the code has been
    run in order to obtain values for the coverage counters.
</P>
