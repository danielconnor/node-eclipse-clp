result(+File)

   Pretty-print a file, including any code coverage results

Arguments
   File                Atom or string

Type
   library(coverage)

Description

    This will pretty-print the given source file, annotated with the
    values of code coverage counters. The resulting .html file will be
    placed in a sub-directory called 'coverage', relative to File.
    See result/2 for options to modify the output.

    This predicate only makes sense if File has previously been compiled
    in coverage mode (using coverage:ccompile/1,2), and the code has been
    run in order to obtain values for the coverage counters.
