ccompile(+File, +OptionList)

   Compile a file, inserting code coverage counters

Arguments
   File                Atom or string
   OptionList          List of Name:Value pairs

Type
   library(coverage)

Description

    This is a variant of the ECLiPSe compiler that inserts code coverage
    counters into the compiled code. This code can then be run, and the
    results analysed by printing them using coverage:result/1.

    Options to modify the behaviour of the code coverage library are:

    exit_counters (default:on)
    	Setting this to 'off' will suppress coverage counters at the end of
	conjunctions (comma-sequences of subgoals).
    blocks_only (default:off)
    	Setting this to 'on' will leave only coverage counters at the
	beginning and at the end of conjunctions (comma-sequences of
	subgoals) and suppress all others.
    macro_expansion (default:off)
	This options affects only the printing of the result (html) file.
	By default, read-macros are not expanded in this output.  In rare
	cases, where macro expansion would affect the placement of coverage
	counter positions, it may be necessary to set this option to 'on'
	in order to display the counter values at the correct positions
	in the code.
    goal_expansion (default:on)
    	Setting this to 'off' will suppress goal expansion (inlining)
	during compilation. This may be necessary when the processed
	code contains predicates that get executed at compile time.
    verbose (default:off)
    	If set to 'on', the coverage preprocessor will print predicate
	names as they are processed (to log_output).
