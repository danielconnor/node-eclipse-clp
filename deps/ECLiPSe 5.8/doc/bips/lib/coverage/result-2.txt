result(+File, +OptionList)

   Pretty-print a file, including any code coverage results

Arguments
   File                Atom or string
   OptionList          List of Name:Value pairs

Type
   library(coverage)

Description

    This will pretty-print the given source file, annotated with the
    values of code coverage counters. By default, the resulting .html
    file will be placed in a sub-directory called 'coverage', relative
    to File.

    OptionList is a list of options identical to the one accepted by
    pretty_print/2 in the library(pretty_printer), and can be used to
    modify the output style and the location of the output file.

    This predicate only makes sense if File has previously been compiled
    in coverage mode (using coverage:ccompile/1,2), and the code has been
    run in order to obtain values for the coverage counters.
