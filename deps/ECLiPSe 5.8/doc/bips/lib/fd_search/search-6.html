<H2>Description</H2>
<b>Search/6</b> provides a generic interface to a set of different search
methods.  It can currently be used with either the finite domains (if
loaded via lib(fd_search)), or integer IC domains (if loaded via
lib(ic_search)).  By changing the <b>Method</b> argument, different partial
search algorithms (and their parameters) can be selected and
controlled. The search predicate also provides a number of pre-defined
variable selection methods (to choose which variable will be assigned next)
and some pre-defined value assignment methods (to try out the possible
values for the selected variable in some heuristic order), but user-defined
methods can be used in their place as well.  In order to allow more
structure in the application program, it is possible to pass a list of
terms rather than only a list of domain variables. In this way all
information about some entity can be easily grouped together. It also
allows more complex labeling methods which combine the assignment of
multiple variables (like a preference value and a decision variable).

<p>
All search methods use a <i>stable</i> selection method. If several entries have the 
same heuristic value, then the first one is selected.
The rest of the list is equal to the original list with the selected entry removed,
the order of the non-selected entries does not change.
<p>
Integer values are not treated differently from the domain variables,
they are selected only if their heuristic value is better than those of the 
other entries.
<p>
The pre-defined <b>selection methods</b> use the following criteria:
<ul>
<li><b>input_order</b> the first entry in the list is selected</li>
<li><b>first_fail</b> the entry with the smallest domain size is selected</li>
<li><b>anti_first_fail</b> the entry with the largest domain size is selected</li>
<li><b>smallest</b> the entry with the smallest value in the domain is selected</li>
<li><b>largest</b> the entry with the largest value in the domain is selected</li>
<li><b>occurrence</b> the entry with the largest number of attached constraints is selected</li>
<li><b>most_constrained</b> the entry with the smallest domain size is selected. If several entries have the same domain size, the entry with the largest number of attached constraints is selected.</li>
<li><b>max_regret</b> the entry with the largest difference between the smallest and second smallest value in the domain is selected. This method is typically used if the variable represents a cost, and we are interested in the choice which could increase overall cost the most if the best possibility is not taken. Unfortunately, the implementation sometimes does not always work. If two decision variables incur the same minimal cost, the regret is not calculated as zero, but as the difference from this minimal value to the next greater value.</li>
</ul><p>
Any other name is taken as the name of a user-defined predicate of arity 2
which is expected to compute a selection criterion (typically a number), e.g.
<pre>
my_select(X,Criterion) :-
	...	% compute Criterion from variable X
</pre>
The variable-selection will then select the variable with the lowest
value of Criterion.  If several variables have the same value, the first
one is selected.
<p>
The pre-defined <b>choice methods</b> have the following meaning:
<ul>
<li><b>indomain</b>
uses the built-in indomain/1.  Values are tried in increasing order. 
On failure, the previously tested value is not removed.</li>

<li><b>indomain_min</b>
Values are tried in increasing order.  On failure, the previously
tested value is removed.  The values are tested in the same order as
for <b>indomain</b>, but backtracking may occur earlier.</li>

<li><b>indomain_max</b>
Values are tried in decreasing order.  On failure, the previously
tested value is removed.</li>

<li><b>indomain_middle</b>
Values are tried beginning from the middle of the domain.  On failure,
the previously tested value is removed.</li>

<li><b>indomain_median</b>
Values are tried beginning from the median value of the domain.  On
failure, the previously tested value is removed.</li>

<li><b>indomain_split</b>
Values are tried by succesive domain splitting.  On failure, the
previously tried interval is removed.  This enumerates values in the
same order as indomain or indomain_min, but may fail earlier.</li>

<li><b>indomain_random</b>
Values are tried in a random order.  On backtracking, the previously
tried value is removed.  Using this rutine may lead to unreproducable
results, as another call wil create random numbers in a different
sequence.  This method uses the built-in <b>random/1</b> to create
random numbers, <b>seed/1</b> can be used to force the same number
generation sequence in another run.</li>

<li><b>indomain_interval</b>
If the domain consists of several intervals, we first branch on the
choice of the interval.  For one interval, we use domain
splitting.</li>

</ul><p>
Any other name is taken as the name of a user-defined predicate of
arity 1, e.g.
<pre>
my_choice(X) :-
	...	% make a choice on variable X
</pre>
Alternatively, a term with 2 arguments can be given as the choice-method,
e.g. my_choice(FirstIn,LastOut). this will lead to the invocation of a
choice predicate with arity 3, e.g.
<pre>
my_choice(X,In,Out) :-
	...	% make a choice on variable X, using In-Out
</pre>
This allows user-defined state to be transferred between the subsequent
invocations of the choice-predicate (the Out argument of a call to
my_choice/3 for one variable is unified with the In argument of the call to
my_choice/3 for the next variable, and so on).
<p>
The different <b>search methods</b> are
<ul>
<li><b>complete</b>
a complete search routine which explores all alternative choices.</li>

<li><b>bbs(Steps)</b>
The <i>bounded backtracking search</i> allows <b>Steps</b>
backtracking steps.</li>

<li><b>lds(Disc)</b>
A form of the <i> limited discrepancy search </i>.  This method
iteratively tries 0, 1, 2 ..  <b>Disc</b> changes against the
heuristic (first) value.  Typical values are between 1 and 3 (which
already may create too many alternatives for large problems).  The
original LDS paper stated that the discrepancy to be tested first
should be at the top of the tree.  Our implementation tries the first
discrepancy at the bottom of the tree.  This means that solutions may
be found in a different order compared to the original algorithm. 
This change is imposed by the evaluation strategy used and can not be
easily modified.</li>

<li><b>credit(Credit, bbs(Steps))</b>
The credit based search explores the top of the search tree
completely.  Initially, a given number of credits (<b>Credit</b>) are
given.  At each choice point, the first alternative gets half of the
available credit, the second alternative half of the remaining credit,
and so on.  When the credit run out, the system switches to another
search routine, here bbs.  In each of these bounded backtracking
searches <b>Steps</b> backtracking steps are allowed before returning
to the top most part of the tree and choosing the next remaining
candidate.  A good value for <b>Steps</b> is 5, a value of 0 forces a
deterministic search using the heuristic.  Typical values for
<b>Credit</b> are either N or N*N, where N is the number of entries in
the list.</li>

<li><b>credit(Credit, lds(Disc))</b>
like the one above, but using <i>lds</i> when the credit runs out. 
Typically, only one (perhaps 2) discrepancies should be allowed.</li>

<li><b>dbs(Level, bbs(Steps))</b>
The <i>depth bounded search</i> explores the first <b>Level</b>
choices in the search tree completely, i.e.  it tries all values for
the first <b>Level</b> selected variables.  After that, it switches to
another search method, here bbs.  In each of these searches,
<b>Steps</b> backtracking steps are allowed.  </li>

<li><b>dbs(Level, lds(Disc))</b>
like the method above, but switches to lds after the first
<b>Level</b> variables.</li>

<li><b>sbds</b>
A complete search routine which uses the SBDS symmetry breaking library
(lib(ic_sbds) or lib(fd_sbds)) to exclude symmetric parts of the search tree
from consideration.  The symmetry breaking must be initialised through a
call to sbds_initialise/4,5 before calling search/6.  Currently the only
pre-defined choice methods supported by this search method are
<b>indomain_min</b>, <b>indomain_max</b>, <b>indomain_middle</b>,
<b>indomain_median</b> and <b>indomain_random</b>.  Any user-defined choice
method used in conjunction with this search method must use sbds_try/2 to
assign/exclude values or the symmetry breaking will not work correctly.</li>

<li><b>gap_sbds</b> (Not available for FD.)
A complete search routine which uses the GAP-based SBDS symmetry breaking
library lib(ic_gap_sbds) to exclude symmetric parts of the search tree from
consideration.  The symmetry breaking must be initialised through a call to
sbds_initialise/5 before calling search/6.  Currently the only pre-defined
choice methods supported by this search method are <b>indomain_min</b>,
<b>indomain_max</b>, <b>indomain_middle</b>, <b>indomain_median</b> and
<b>indomain_random</b>.  Any user-defined choice method used in conjunction
with this search method must use sbds_try/2 to assign/exclude values or the
symmetry breaking will not work correctly.</li>

<li><b>gap_sbdd</b> (Not available for FD.)
A complete search routine which uses the GAP-based SBDD symmetry breaking
library lib(ic_gap_sbdd) to exclude symmetric parts of the search tree from
consideration.  The symmetry breaking must be initialised through a call to
sbdd_initialise/5 before calling search/6.  Currently the only pre-defined
choice methods supported by this search method are <b>indomain_min</b>,
<b>indomain_max</b>, <b>indomain_middle</b>, <b>indomain_median</b> and
<b>indomain_random</b>.  Any user-defined choice method used in conjunction
with this search method must use sbdd_try/2 to assign/exclude values or the
symmetry breaking will not work correctly.</li>
</ul>
The option list is used to pass additional parameters to and from the
procedure.  The currently recognized options are:
<ul>
<li><b>backtrack(-N)</b>
returns the number of backtracking steps used in the search
routine</li>

<li><b>nodes(++N)</b>
sets an upper limit on the number of nodes explored in the search.  If
the given limit is exceeded, the search routine stops the exploration
of the search tree.</li>

<li><b>node(daVinci)</b>
create a drawing of the search tree using the daVinci grapg drawing
tool.  Each node of the search tree is shown as a node in the tree. 
The label of the node is the selected term of the list.</li>

<li><b>node(daVinci(++Call))</b>
as the previous option, it creates a drawing of the search tree using
the daVinci graph drawing tool.  But instead of using the complete
selected term as the label, it call the predicate <b>Call/2</b> to
choose which part of the selected term to display.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
Fails if the search tree generated does not contain any solution. 
For partial search methods, this does not mean that the problem does not 
have a solution, but only that the part of the tree generated did not 
contain one.
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
yes
