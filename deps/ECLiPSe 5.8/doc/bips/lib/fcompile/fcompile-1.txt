Arguments
   File                Name of source file (Atom or string)

Type
   library(fcompile)

Description
  Same as fcompile/2 with all options set to their default
     values: the object file is placed in the current working directory,
     byte format is generated, non-verbose, and fcompile tries to
     compile the program first.
