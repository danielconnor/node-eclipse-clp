lib(fcompile)

The fcompile library is used to generate object files from 
ECLiPSe source files.  

An object file has suffix 'eco', and is a platform independent object
format which can be loaded into other sessions of ECLiPSe, much as an
ECLiPSe source file. The may however not be portable between different
versions of ECLiPSe.
