alldifferent(+List,++Capacity)

   The list List contains at most Capacity elements of each value

Type
   library(ic_global)

Description
    This is a generalization of alldifferent/1. It allows repeated
    elements in the list, but there can be no more than Capacity elements with
    a particular value.
    
    Any input variables which do not already have finite bounds will
    be given default bounds of -10000000 to 10000000.
