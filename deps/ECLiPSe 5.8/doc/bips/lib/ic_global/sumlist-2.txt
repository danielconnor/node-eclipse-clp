sumlist(+List, ?Sum)

   The sum of the list elements is Sum

Arguments
   List                List of integers or domain variables
   Sum                 Variable or integer

Type
   library(ic_global)

Description
    	  The sum of the list elements is Sum.  This constraint is
	  more efficient than the general arithmetic constraint if
	  the list is long and Sum is not constrained frequently.
	  
	  Any input variables which do not already have finite bounds will
	  be given default bounds of -10000000 to 10000000.
