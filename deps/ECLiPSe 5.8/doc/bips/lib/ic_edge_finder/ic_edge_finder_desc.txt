lib(ic_edge_finder)

   
    This library implements the quadratic edge-finder algorithm for the
    disjunctive and cumulative scheduling constraints for the IC solver.
    It provides stronger propagation than the ic_cumulative library, but
    weaker than the cubic ic_edge_finder3 library for cumulative
    constraints.  It is however computationally cheaper than the
    ic_edge_finder3 library.

    Note that the same predicates are implemented in both ic_edge_finder
    and ic_edge_finder3 libraries.
