lib(gnuplot)

 This library provides an interface to the function and data
 plotting program - gnuplot.

 The gnuplot program is available for most platforms and can be
 downloaded from http://www.gnuplot.info/.
 This version of lib(gnuplot) officially supports gnuplot version 3.7
 and higher though it may work with earlier versions as well.

 The executable gnuplot on Unices, and
 pgnuplot.exe on Windows must be installed on the default
 path, or be present in the current working directory. 
 NOTE: On Windows it is NOT sufficient to simply have the
 gnuplot.exe or wgnuplot.exe, you must have the
 pgnuplot.exe as well.

 See the various plot predicates for further example usage.

 For a complete description of the avilable options we refer the
 user to the excellent documentation which accompanies gnuplot.  
 Most features have an obvious analogue in this library.
