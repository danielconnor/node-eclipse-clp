lib(ic_edge_finder3)

   
    This library implements the cubic edge-finder algorithm for the
    disjunctive and cumulative scheduling constraints for the IC solver.
    It provides the strongest propagation of the three libraries for
    cumulative constraints: ic_cumulative, ic_edge_finder and
    ic_edge_finder3.  It is also computationally the most expensive.

    Note that the same predicates are implemented in both ic_edge_finder
    and ic_edge_finder3 libraries.
