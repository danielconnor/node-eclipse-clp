cumulative(+StartTimes, +Durations, +Resources, +Areas, ++ResourceLimit)

   Cumulative constraint on specified tasks.

Arguments
   StartTimes          List of start times for tasks (fd variables or integers)
   Durations           List of duration for tasks (fd variables or integers)
   Resources           List of resource usages by tasks (fd variables or integers)
   Areas               List of areas covered by tasks (fd variables or integers)
   ResourceLimit       Maximum amount of resource available (integer)

Type
   library(ic_edge_finder3)

Description

   In this variant, an area (the product of duration and resource usage of
   a task) can be specified, e.g. if duration or reource usage are not
   known in advance. The edge-finder algorithm can make use of this information
   to derive bound updates.

   Any input variables which do not already have finite bounds will be
   given default bounds of -10000000 to 10000000.
