probe_search(+Bivs, +BivSums, ++Resource, ++Options, +Handle)

   Add alternative constraints to try and repair infeasible probes

Arguments
   Bivs                A list of lists of binary integer variables
   BivSums             A list of integer variables, each one the sum of a list 
                      of binaries
   Resource            An integer quantity of resource available
   Options             An options structure
   Handle              A linear solver handle

Type
   library(probe_search)

Description

    Based on the tentative assignments, probe_search finds a task
    start time where the resources are not sufficient to make the
    tentative assignment feasible.  In case a bottleneck task has a
    variable resource requirement, this is reduced to its minimum
    possible value. Otherwise, probe_search chooses a binary
    'overlap' variable at this bottleneck and using add_con it adds 
    a constraint trying to eliminate the overlap.



Resatisfiable
   no
