?Vars tent_set ++Values

   Assigns tentative values for the variables in a term.

Arguments
   Vars                Term with variables (non-ground term)
   Values              Tentative values for variables in Vars (ground term)

Type
   library(repair)

Description

Associate tentative values with variables. Vars can be any non-ground term,
and Values the corresponding ground term. The tentative values of the
variables are set to the ground values in Values. Typically Var is a
variable or a list of variables.


A tentative value is generally used to record preferred or previous
assigments to this variable. It does not actually bind the variable to the
value.  It can be changed through later calls to tent_set. Together with
other tentative values and actual values for the problem variables in a
program, they can form a tentative assignment which may be a partial or
inconsistent solution to the problem. Variables with inconsistent tentative
values are known as non-tenable.



Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Vars is non-unifiable with Values

Examples
   
% lib(fd) is loaded

[eclipse 3]: X::1..5, X tent_set 3.
X = X{fd:[1..5], repair:3} % X is tenable 

[eclipse 3]: X::1..5, X tent_set 7.
X = X{fd:[1..5], repair:7} % X is non-tenable
