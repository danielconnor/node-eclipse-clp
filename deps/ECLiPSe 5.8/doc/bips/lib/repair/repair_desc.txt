lib(repair)

The repair library provides a framework for the integration of repair-based
search with the constraint consistency checking techniques of ECLiPSe. It
allows the implementation of classical local search methods within a CLP
environment.

It provides two facilities:



 The maintenance of tentative values for problem variables. These
    tentative values may together form a partial or even inconsistent 
    tentative assignment.  Modifications to, or extensions of this
    assignment may be applied until a correct solution is found.

 The monitoring of constraints (the so called repair constraints)
    for being either satisfied or violated under the current tentative
    assignment.  Search algorithms can then access the set of
    constraints that are violated at any point in the search,
    and perform repairs by changing the tentative assignment
    of the problem variables.


Normally, the repair library communicates with another solver (such as fd or 
ria) to check for constraint violations.
