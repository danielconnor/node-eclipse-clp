conflict_constraints(+ConflictSet, -Constraints)

   Retreive the set of conflicting constraints monitored in ConflictSet.

Arguments
   ConflictSet         name or handle of a conflict set
   Constraints         List of conflicting constraints in ConflictSet (variable)

Type
   library(repair)

Description

When a repair constraint goes into conflict (i.e. when it does not satisfy
the tentative assignment of its variables), it appears in a conflict set,
once it satisfies the tentative assignment, it disappears.
This primitive returns the list of all current conflict constraints
in the given conflict set.


ConflictSet is the conflict set name (or handle) which has
been used in the corresponding constraint annotation.  For example


conflict_constraints(cap_cstr, Conflicts)


would retrieve all constraints that were annotated with cap_cstr
and are currently in conflict.


Resatisfiable
   no
