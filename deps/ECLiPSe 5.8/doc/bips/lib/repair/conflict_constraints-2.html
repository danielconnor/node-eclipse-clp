<H1>conflict_constraints(+ConflictSet, -Constraints)</H1>
Retreive the set of conflicting constraints monitored in ConflictSet.
<DL>
<DT><EM>ConflictSet</EM></DT>
<DD>name or handle of a conflict set
</DD>
<DT><EM>Constraints</EM></DT>
<DD>List of conflicting constraints in ConflictSet (variable)
</DD>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
When a repair constraint goes into conflict (i.e. when it does not satisfy
the tentative assignment of its variables), it appears in a conflict set,
once it satisfies the tentative assignment, it disappears.
This primitive returns the list of all current conflict constraints
in the given conflict set.

</P><P>
ConflictSet is the conflict set name (or handle) which has
been used in the corresponding constraint annotation.  For example

<TT>
conflict_constraints(cap_cstr, Conflicts)
</TT>

would retrieve all constraints that were annotated with <TT>cap_cstr</TT>
and are currently in conflict.
