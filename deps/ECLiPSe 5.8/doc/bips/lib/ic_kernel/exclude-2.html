<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Primitive for excluding an element from the domain of an integer
   variable.  The call may fail (when Var is the same integer as Excl),
   succeed (possibly updating the variable's domain), or instantiate the
   variable (when Excl was one of only two domain elements left).</P><P>

   Note that this predicate is intended for use only in implementing
   constraint propagators, and should not be called from ordinary user code
   (use ic:(Var =\= Excl) instead).  It differs from the usual constraint
   predicates with respect to the execution of delayed goals.  If the call
   to exclude/2 results in a domain change, any delayed goals suspended on
   that change will be scheduled for execution, as normal.  However,
   exclude/2 does not call the woken goal scheduler (wake/0), so these goals
   may not be executed immediately.  (It is possible that under some
   circumstances the goals will be executed, if wake/0 is called indirectly
   - one example would be by the unify handler if the variable becomes
   ground - but this should not be relied upon.)  To ensure that the goals
   are eventually executed, the caller should arrange for wake/0 to be
   called at some appropriate point in the subsequent execution.  Please see
   the "Advanced Control Features" section of the User Manual for more
   information about woken goal management.</P>

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>[eclipse 3]: X :: 0..10, exclude(X, 4).
X = X{[0 .. 3, 5 .. 10]}
Yes (0.00s cpu)

[eclipse 4]: X :: [4, 6], exclude(X, 4).
X = 6
Yes (0.00s cpu)
