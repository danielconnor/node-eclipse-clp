impose_bounds(?Var, ++Lo, ++Hi)

   Update (if required) the bounds of Var.

Arguments
   Var                 Variable or number
   Lo                  Lower bound
   Hi                  Upper bound

Type
   library(ic_kernel)

Description

   Primitive for updating the upper and lower bounds of Var, also used as
   the set_bounds handler for the IC attribute.  As with impose_min/2 and
   impose_max/2, it is intended for use in implementing constraint
   propagators, and should not be called from ordinary user code (use $::/2
   or ::/2 instead).  Its semantics is essentially:

       impose_min(Var, Lo), impose_max(Var, Hi), wake.

   Please see the documentation for impose_min/2 and impose_max/2 for more
   details.
