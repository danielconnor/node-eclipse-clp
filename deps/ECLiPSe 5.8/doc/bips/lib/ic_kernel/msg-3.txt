msg(?Var1, ?Var2, ?MSG)

   Computes the most specific generalisation of the intervals in Var1 and Var2.

Arguments
   Var1                A variable or number
   Var2                A variable or number
   MSG                 Most specific generalisation (variable)

Type
   library(ic_kernel)

Description

   The most specific generalisation of two intervals is computed and
   returned as MSG.  MSG will interval over the smallest interval enclosing
   the input intervals, and have the more general type of the input types.
   If either Var1 or Var2 have not been declared before, it will be turned
   into an unrestricted real variable.
