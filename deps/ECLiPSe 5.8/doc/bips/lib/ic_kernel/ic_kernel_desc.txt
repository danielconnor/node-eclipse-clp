lib(ic_kernel)


This module provides a low-level interface to the core of the IC solver;
that is, a set of predicates for accessing and manipulating IC variables.
It is not intended for use by general user code (use the interface provided
by the `ic' module for that), but rather for those wishing to implement
their own constraints which use IC variables.  This could either be to
augment IC by providing new constraints or functionality, or to build a
complete constraint solver capable of cooperating with any other solver
which also uses the common numeric variable format provided by IC.
