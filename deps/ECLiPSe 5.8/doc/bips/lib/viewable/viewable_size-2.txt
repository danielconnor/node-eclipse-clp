viewable_size(++ViewableName, ?SizeList)

   Query the sizes of the dimensions of an existent viewable.

Arguments
   ViewableName        A string or atom: the name of an existent viewable
   SizeList            A list of integers: each is the current size of a dimension

Type
   library(viewable)

Description
 NOTE:When there are no registered visualisation clients, this
        predicate fails with all arguments, and has no effect.

            If ViewableName is the name of an existent viewable,
	    SizeList is unified with a list of integers, each
	    integer being the number of elements in one of the viewable's
	    dimensions.

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if ViewableName is not
	    instantiated to the name of an existent viewable, or if
	    SizeList fails to unify with the list of dimension sizes.



Exceptions
     4 --- ViewableName is not a string or an atom
     5 --- SizeList is not a free variable or list or contains one or more elements which is not a free variable or an integer

Examples
   

[Assuming that at least one visualisation client is registered]

	Success:

	viewable_create(v1, [], 
			array([flexible, flexible, flexible], any)), 
	viewable_size(v1, X).
        [gives X = [0,0,0]]

	viewable_create(v1, []([](R,S), [](Q,W)), 
			array([fixed, fixed], any)), 
	viewable_size(v1, X).
        [gives X = [2,2]]


	Failure:

	viewable_size(no, X).

	viewable_create(v1, []([](R,S), [](Q,W)), 
			array([fixed, fixed], any)), 
	viewable_size(v1, [1,2]).



        Exceptions raised:

	viewable_size(_, X).
        [gives error 4]

	viewable_size(123, X).
        [gives error 4]

	viewable_create(v1, [X, Y, Z]), 
	viewable_size(v1, q).
        [gives error 5]

	viewable_create(v1, [X, Y, Z]), 
	viewable_size(v1, [a]).
        [gives error 5]
