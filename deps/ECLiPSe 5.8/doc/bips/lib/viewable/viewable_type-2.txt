viewable_type(++ViewableName, ?Type)

   Query the type of an existent viewable.

Arguments
   ViewableName        A string or atom: the name of an existent viewable
   Type                The type of the viewable. 

Type
   library(viewable)

Description


        NOTE:When there are no registered visualisation clients,
        this predicate fails with all arguments, and has no effect.

        If ViewableName is the name of an existent viewable,
        Type is unified with its type. See
        viewable_create/3 for a discussion of valid viewable
        types.




Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if ViewableName is not instantiated to the name of an existent viewable, or if Type fails to unify with the viewable's type.

Exceptions
     4 --- ViewableName is not a string or an atom

Examples
   

[Assuming that at least one visualisation client is registered]

	Success:

	viewable_create(v1, []([](R,S), [](Q,W)), 
			array([fixed, fixed], any)), 
	viewable_type(v1, X).

        [gives X = array([fixed, fixed], any)]


	Failure:

	viewable_create(v1, []([](R,S), [](Q,W)), 
		array([fixed, fixed], any)), 
	viewable_type(v1, q).


	Exceptions raised:

	viewable_create(v1, []([](R,S), [](Q,W)), 
		array([fixed, fixed], any)), 
	viewable_type(123, _).
        [gives error 4]
