viewable_expand(++ViewableName, ++DimensionNumber, +ExtraElements, ++LocName)

   Expand a dimension of a viewable by adding new elements, specifying the name of the new location.

Arguments
   ViewableName        A string or atom; the name of an existent viewable
   DimensionNumber     An integer: the number of the dimension to be enlarged.
   ExtraElements       A nested list or an array of the right size/dimensions, containing the new viewable elements.
   LocName             A string: the name of the new location.

Type
   library(viewable)

Description


        NOTE:When there are no registered visualisation clients,
        this predicate succeeds with any arguments, and has no effect.

        This predicate behaves exactly the same as viewable_expand/3 except that you have the added ability to name the new location of the expanded dimension. LocName is a string which becomes the name for the new location. 

        For more details on expanding viewables, see the documentation for viewable_expand/3. 



Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if ViewableName is not the name of an existent viewable, or if the requested dimension of the viewable is not flexible.

Exceptions
     4 --- ViewableName is not a string or atom
     5 --- DimensionNumber is not a ground integer
     6 --- DimensionNumber is not positive, or exceeds the viewable's number of dimensions
     1 --- ExtraElements is not a regular nested list or array of the correct size/dimensions
     5 --- ExtraElements contains elements which do not conform to the element type of the viewable
     5 --- LocName is not a string

Examples
   

[Assuming that at least one visualisation client is registered]

       viewable_create(v1, [[X, Y, Z], [A, B, C]], 
       	               array([flexible, fixed], any)), 
       viewable_expand(v1, 1, [R, S, T], "barg").

       This will add to the 2 x 3 viewable a third row, named "barg".

       viewable_create(v1, [[X, Y, Z], [A, B, C]], 
       	               array([fixed, flexible], any)), 
       viewable_expand(v1, 2, [Q, P], "zatch").

       This will add to the 2 x 3 viewable a fourth column, named "zatch".
