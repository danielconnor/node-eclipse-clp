viewable_create(?ViewableName, +Elements)

   Create a viewable.

Arguments
   ViewableName        A string or atom; the name of the new viewable.
   Elements            A possibly nested list or array (as created for example by dim/2).

Type
   library(viewable)

Description


        NOTE:When there are no registered visualisation clients,
        this predicate succeeds with any arguments, and has no effect.

	This predicate creates a new viewable by specifying its name and
	elements. The predicate will try to guess the number of dimensions
	for the new viewable from the level of nesting in
	Elements. All dimensions are set to fixed so
	they cannot be expanded later. The element type is set to
	any. For more control over the number and fixity of
	dimensions and the element type, use
	viewable_create/3.

        In other ways the predicate behaves just like
        viewable_create/3. See the documentation for that
        predicate for more details. 

Resatisfiable
   no

Exceptions
     4 --- ViewableName is not an atom, string or free variable.
     1 --- ViewableName is the name of an existent viewable.
     1 --- Elements is not a nested list or array.

Examples
   

[Assuming that at least one visualisation client is registered]

       Success:

       viewable_create(viewable1, [X, Y, Z]).

       viewable_create("viewable1", [](X, Y, Z)).

       viewable_create(m, []).

       viewable_create(var23, [[],[],[]]).

       viewable_create(var315, []([]([](R, T, [E, X, Y]), 
                                     [](W, T, grok(D))), 
				  []([](A, B, C),
				     [](R, E, W)))).



       Exceptions raised:

       viewable_create(2, [x,y,z]).
       [gives error 4] 

       viewable_create(v1, [x,y,z]), 
       viewable_create(v1, [x,y,z]).
       [gives error 1] 

       viewable_create(v1, _).
