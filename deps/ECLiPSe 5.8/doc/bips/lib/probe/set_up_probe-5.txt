set_up_probe(+Tasks, +Constraints, -Cost, ++Options, -Handle)

   Sets up a linear probe for a set of constraints

Arguments
   Tasks               A term containing some variables
   Constraints         A list of numerical constraints
   Cost                A cost variable
   Options             An options structure
   Handle              A variable which will record the handle of the matrix 
used by the linear solver

Type
   library(probe)

Description

The constraints are passed to add_con, which adds them to both the 
fd and linear solvers.  The cost is declared to be an integer.  All the 
finite domain variables in the term Tasks are associated with a demon 
which forwards their bounds to the linear solver.  (The priority of this 
demon is one higher than that of the probe.)

lp_demon_setup is then invoked to set up the linear solver, with the 
priority specified in the Options parameter.  Solutions returned
by the linear solver are automatically used to update the tentative values  
of all the variables.



Resatisfiable
   no

Examples
   
?- Options = options{granularity:3,priority:5},
   Cost=X1,
   set_up_probe([X1,X2,X3],[X1>X2,X2>X3],Cost,Options,H).
