add_con(+Constraint, ++Options, +Handle)

   Add a constraint to the fd and linear solvers

Arguments
   Constraint          A numerical constraint, with functor 
                         '=:=', '>=', '=<', '>' or '<'
   Options             An options structure
   Handle              A linear solver handle

Type
   library(probe)

Description
 
If the inequality is strict, X>Y or X', then the granularity 
 specified in the options is added to the smaller term to create a non-strict 
 inequality, which can be passed to the linear solver.  Thus if the granularity
 is 3, then for X>Y the constraint X>=Y+3 is added to the 
 linear  solver and  X#>=Y+3  is added to the fd solver.
