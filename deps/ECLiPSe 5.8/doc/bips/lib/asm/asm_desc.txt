lib(asm)

       The asm library provide tools for assembling and disassembling the WAM
    code representation of predicates to and from memory. It also allows
    the formatted printing of the WAM code. This library is used by the
    fcompile library to generate the object code, which is a form of the
    WAM code that can be read back in and assembled into the predicates.
