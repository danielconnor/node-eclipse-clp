asm(+PredSpec, +WAMCode)

   Assemble the WAM instructions WAMCode into ECLiPSe as predicate PredSpec. 



Arguments
   +PredSpec           Atom/Integer.
   +WAMCode            A list of WAM instructions in the right format.

Type
   library(asm)

Description
   Assembles the WAM instruction WAMCode into the current ECLiPSe session
   as the predicate PredSpec. The WAM code is in the form of a list, with
   each element representing one WAM instruction. The format of the WAMCode
   is the same as that generated by disasm/2,3. Thus the predicate can be
   used to load a predicate previously dissasembled by disasm/2,3 without
   having to compile the source Prolog form of the predicate.


   The library asm must be loaded to use diasm/2.


   If PredSpec is an existing defined predicate, the older definition will
   be replaced. If WAMCode is not in the correct format, an exception will
   be generated and the predicate PredSpec would not be redefined. 




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- PredSpec is not in correct form.
     6 --- WAMCode is not in correct form.
