wam(+PredSpec)

   Prints the formatted WAM code for predicate PredSpec.



Arguments
   +PredSpec           Atom, or Atom/Integer

Type
   library(asm)

Description
   Prints the WAM instructions representing the predicate specified by
   PredSpec from the current module in a formatted form. Requires the 
   library asm to be loaded.


   If PredSpec is an atom (i.e. no arity is given), then a predicate with
   that name is printed, and if there are more than one predicate defined
   (i.e. same name but different arities), then these different predicates
   will be printed by backtracking.


   This predicate is intended as a replacement for the lower level als/1,
   which performs the same function. The differences are that the abstract
   instruction names are printed in a more human oriented form (rather than
   the internal names used by ECLiPSe), and labels and their references are
   printed symbolically. Note that the predicate is implemented via the
   disasm/3 predicate of the library, and hence the same restrictions
   applies: it cannot be used to print the code for dynamic predicates.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      If PredSpec is a dynamic predicate.



Exceptions
     5 --- PredSpec not in correct form.
    60 --- PredSpec not defined in the current module.
