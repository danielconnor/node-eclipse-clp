pasm(+WAMCode, ?Size, ?Object)

   Partially assemble WAMCode into an object format.



Arguments
   +WAMCode            A list of WAM instructions in the right format.
   ?Size               Variable or integer
   ?Object             A list of object words in the right format.

Type
   library(asm)

Description
   Partially assemble the WAM instructions given WAMCode without loading it
   into the current session. Instead, an object format is generated. This
   object format can be loaded into an ECLiPSe session using the low level
   built-in store_pred/5. fcompile/1,2 uses this predicate to generate the
   object code for predicates.


   The partially assembled code consists of Object, which is a typed
   representation of the words that need to be stored into memory; and
   Size, the size in words that this object code will occupy in memory.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      If WAMCode is not in correct format.
