<H1>EplexInstance:eplex_var_get(+Var, ++What, -Value)</H1>
Obtain information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

<DT><EM>Var</EM></DT>
<DD>A solver problem variable for solver associated with EplexInstance

<DD>Specification for information wanted (atom)

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Retrieve information about solver state and results related to a
   particular variable or constraint, for the eplex instance EplexInstance.
   Fails if no solution has been computed yet.  What can take one of the
   following values:

<DL>
    <DT><TT>solution</TT>
    <DD>Returns the floating-point solution for variable Var.
<P>

    <DT><TT>typed_solution</TT>
    <DD>Returns the properly typed (integer or float) solution for variable
        Var, depending on if the variable was constrained to be an integer
        or not for EplexInstance.
<P>

    <DT><TT>reduced_cost</TT>
    <DD>Returns the reduced cost for variable Var. If the problem is a MIP, 
        then depending on the external solver, this is either unavailable
        or is the value at the optimal LP node. 

</DL>
<P>
  Note that solution or reduced_cost can only be retrieved
  when previously requested in the option list of eplex_solver_setup/4,
  lp_demon_setup/5, lp_setup/4 or with lp_set/3.
</P>
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Handle is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Handle is not a compound term.
<DT><EM>(6) out of range </EM>
<DD>What is not a valid value.
<DT><EM>(6) out of range </EM>
<DD>Var is not a problem variable for Handle.
<DT><EM>(6) out of range </EM>
<DD>What is unavailable; the information was not requested at solver setup.
</DL>
