EplexInstance:reals(?Vars)

   Constraints Vars to the real domain for EplexInstance.

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or number, or a list or submatrix of variables/numbers

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
	Constrains Vars to the real domain in the eplex instance
        EplexInstance. Any variables that are not problem variables
        for EplexInstance are added to the problem, with unconstrained
        bounds (except by the external solver's idea of infinity).

        Note that the notion of real is used here in the pure mathematical
        sense, where real numbers subsume the integers. If the variables
        are already instantiated, this call checks that the variable is
        instantiated to a number.
        

Fail Conditions
   Vars contain elements which are neither variable or number.
