lp_add(+Handle, +NewNormCons, +NewIntegers)

   Add new constraints to a solver state Handle.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state
   NewNormCons         List of new normalised constraints
   NewIntegers         List of variables to be considered as integers

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

  Add new normalised constraints (with possibly new variables) to a solver.
  This is a lower level predicate called by lp_add_constraints/3 and when
  constraints are collected from the constraints pool by the solver. The
  constraints are not simplified and must already be normalised, so
  constraints which would otherwise be simplified away by the higher level
  predicates can be added to the external solver. The constraints will be
  removed on backtracking. Note that the solver will not be invoked directly.

  Note that variables in NewIntegers can be any problem variables. In
  previous versions of ECLiPSe, there was a restriction that the variables
  be new problem variables; this restriction has been removed.
