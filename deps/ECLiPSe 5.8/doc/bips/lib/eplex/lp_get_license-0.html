<H1>lp_get_license</H1>
Get a runtime license token for the external solver.
<H2>Description</H2>
    	The eplex-library interfaces to an external simplex/MIP solver
	which might require a license to run (e.g. CPLEX, XPRESS-MP).
	When the eplex-library is loaded, it tries to obtain a license
	immediately.  If this is not possible, for example because the
	license pool is temporarily empty, a warning is printed. The
	application program should then call lp_get_license/0 later
	to obtain a license before any eplex functionality is used.
	If a license is successfully obtained or already held,
	lp_get_license succeeds, otherwise it fails.
    <P>
    	This predicate uses information from the file eplex_lic_info.ecl
	in the ECLiPSe library directory, or solver specific environment
	variable settings to locate the licensing information.
    
<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
Fails if no license can (currently) be obtained
