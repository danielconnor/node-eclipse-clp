<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Similar to eplex_solve/1, but the problem is first temporarily modified
   as specified in Probes. Probes is a list of one or more probe
   specification that specifies how the problem is modified. After the call
   to this predicate, the problem is restored for the external
   solver. However, the result from the probe (obtainable from
   eplex_var_get/3 and eplex_get/2) are retained.
</P><P>
   The following probe specifcations are allowed:
<DL>
    <DT>min(Expr)/max(Expr)<DD>
        Minimise/maximise the problem with the objective function Expr.
        Only existing problem variables can be given in Expr. Cannot be
        used in conjunction with objsense or objexpr.
    <DT>objsense(Sense)<DD>
        Sense is either min or max. Solves the problem with the original
        objective function, but with the sense given in Sense rather than
        that specified at setup. If only the sense of the objective is to 
        be changed, this changes the objective more efficiently than using
        min(Expr)/max(Expr). Cannot be used in conjunction with min/max or
        objexpr.
    <DT>objexpr(Expr)<DD>
        Optimise the problem with respect to the objective function Expr,
        without changing the optimisation direction specified at problem
        setup. Cannot be used in conjunction with objsense or min/max.
    <DT>fixed<DD>
        The problem is solved as an LP problem by `fixing' the integer
        variables to their optimal MIP solution values. If there is an
        existing MIP solution for the problem, eplex will try to use that;
        otherwise, the problem is first solved as a MIP problem
        first. `Fixed' probing is useful for providing reduced costs for
        MIP problems. Note that reduced costs for the variables are only be
        available if the reduced_cost option is set to yes for the problem
        (this can be done either at problem setup, or by using
        eplex_set/2). For a problem without integer variables, the original
        problem is solved without change.  Note that this probe
        specification is not available if the mip_use_copy option is set to
        no for external solvers that cannot modify a MIP problem.  Cannot
        be used in conjunction with `relaxed'.
    <DT>relaxed<DD>
        The problem is solved as an LP problem by relaxing all the integer
        constraints.  For a problem with integer variables, this should be
        equivalent to the initial relaxation solved at the start of the MIP
        search. Depending on the solver, the discreteness of the integer
        variables may still be taken into account during presolve. To
        ensure that the problem solved is exactly the LP problem without
        any integer constraints, presolve should be off. For a problem
        without integer variables, the original problem is solved without
        change. Note that this probe specification is not available if the
        mip_use_copy option is set to no for external solvers that cannot
        modify a MIP problem. Cannot be used in conjunction with `fixed'.
