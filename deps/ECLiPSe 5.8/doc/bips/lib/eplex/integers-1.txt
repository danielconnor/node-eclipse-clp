EplexInstance:integers(?Vars)

   Constrains Vars to integers for eplex instance EplexInstance.

Arguments
   Vars                Variable or number, or a list or submatrix of variables/numbers

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
	Constrains list Vars to integers in the eplex instance
        EplexInstance. If a variable in Vars is not already a problem
        variable for EplexInstance, it will be added as a new problem
        variable. The external solver will then take the integrality into
        account, i.e. to solve a MIP/MIQP rather than a relaxed LP/QP
        problem.  Unlike integers/1 constraints from other solvers, the
        variables are not constrained to be integer type at the ECLiPSe
        level. However, when a typed_solution is retrieved (e.g. via
        eplex_var_get/3), this will be rounded to the nearest integer.
	
	Note that even when problem variables have been declared as
        integers in other solvers (ic or other external solver
        states), if the integrality constraint is not made known to this
        EplexInstance, any invocation of the eplex external solver (e.g. via
        eplex_solve/1) will only solve a continuous relaxation.
