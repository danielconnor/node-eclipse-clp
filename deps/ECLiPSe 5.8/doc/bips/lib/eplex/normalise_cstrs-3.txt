normalise_cstrs(+Constraints, -NormConstraints, -NonlinConstraints)

   Normalise the linear constraints in Constraints.

Arguments
   Constraints         List of arithmetic relations
   NormConstraints     Linear constraints from Constraints (normalised)
   NonlinConstraints   Non-linear constraints from Constraints

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
  Constraints is a list of terms of the form X $= Y, X $>= Y or X $=< Y (or
  their non-$ equivalents)  where X and Y are arithmetic expressions.  The linear
  constraints are returned in normalised form in NormConstraints, the
  nonlinear ones are returned unchanged in NonlinConstr.
