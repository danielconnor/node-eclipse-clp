EplexInstance:piecewise_linear_hull(?X, ++Points, ?Y)

   Relates X and Y according to a piecewise linear function.

Arguments
   X                   Parameter/domain of the piecewise function
   Points              List of points defining the piecewise function
   Y                   Result/range of piecewise the function

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

This predicate imposes the constraint Y = f(X), where f is a piecewise
linear function defined by Points.  Please see the documentation for
piecewise_linear/3 for details of how the piecewise linear function is
specified.

This predicate extends piecewise_linear/3 by also computing the convex hull
of the portions of the constraint which are feasible with respect to the
current bounds (stored with the IC bounds) of X and Y.  Constraints (and
 bounds) defining this convex hull are then
passed to the eplex solver.  These constraints are updated whenever new
bounds on X or Y change the convex hull.

This implementation of the piecewise
constraint accepts bounded reals in its arguments, but it
does not fully support bounded reals of non-zero width (i.e.
those which do not correspond to a single floating point value).  As a
result, use of such bounded reals is not recommended at this time.
