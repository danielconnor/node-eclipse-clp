instantiation_deviates(+Handle)

   A trigger goal for lp_demon_setup/5.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state

Type
   library(eplex)

Description


  This is intended as a useful pre(Goal) for lp_demon_setup/5 in connection
  with the inst trigger mode.  It succeeds if any of the variables
  originally involved in Handle have been instantiated to a value that is
  not within +/- tolerance from the latest simplex solution for that
  variable.  The admissible tolerances can be specified in lp_setup/4 or
  lp_set/3 as demon_tolerance.
