Setup an external solver state for eplex instance EplexInstance
<DL>
<DT><EM>Objective</EM></DT>
<DD>Objective function: min(CostExpr) or max(CostExpr)
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
  Setup a new external solver state for the eplex instance EplexInstance. 
  The solver state will be associated with EplexInstance;
  EplexInstance must not already have a solver state associated with it.
  Once the solver state is setup, it can be invoked (e.g. via eplex_solve/1 
  or eplex_probe/2) to optimise the Objective function. 
</P><P>
    CostExpr is a linear expression
    (or quadratic if supported by the external solver).
</P><P>
  Declaratively, this can be seen as a compound constraint representing all
  the individual linear constraints that have been set so far and are going
  to be set up later for <TT>EplexInstance</TT>. The invoking of this 
  constraint is done explicitly by the user, usually via eplex_solve/1.
  Operationally, when the external solver is invoked, the delayed 
  constraints posted to <TT>EplexInstance</TT> are collected and taken into
  account.
</P><P>
  This is a simplified version of eplex_solver_setup/4, it is equivalent to
  calling eplex_solver_setup/4 with the following defaults:
<PRE>
       eplex_solver_setup(Objective, _, [], 0, [])
</PRE>
