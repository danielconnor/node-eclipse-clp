EplexInstance:eplex_var_get(+Var, ++What, -Value)

   Obtain information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

Arguments
   Var                 A solver problem variable for solver associated with EplexInstance
   What                Specification for information wanted (atom)
   Value               Returned value of What

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Retrieve information about solver state and results related to a
   particular variable or constraint, for the eplex instance EplexInstance.
   Fails if no solution has been computed yet.  What can take one of the
   following values:


    solution
    Returns the floating-point solution for variable Var.


    typed_solution
    Returns the properly typed (integer or float) solution for variable
        Var, depending on if the variable was constrained to be an integer
        or not for EplexInstance.


    reduced_cost
    Returns the reduced cost for variable Var. If the problem is a MIP, 
        then depending on the external solver, this is either unavailable
        or is the value at the optimal LP node. 



  Note that solution or reduced_cost can only be retrieved
  when previously requested in the option list of eplex_solver_setup/4,
  lp_demon_setup/5, lp_setup/4 or with lp_set/3.


Exceptions
     4 --- Handle is not instantiated.
     5 --- Handle is not a compound term.
     6 --- What is not a valid value.
     6 --- Var is not a problem variable for Handle.
     6 --- What is unavailable; the information was not requested at solver setup.
