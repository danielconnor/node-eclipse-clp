EplexInstance:eplex_write(++Format,++File)

   Write the problem in the solver for eplex instance  EplexInstance to a file.

Arguments
   Format              lp or mps
   File                File name

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Write the problem in the solver for EplexInstance to a file. The set of
   supported formats depends on the actual external solver which is used.
   All solvers support the mps format. Some solvers on some operating
   system platforms may change or append a suffix to the filename. 
   Note that the mps format does not specify the sense (min or max) of the
   objective function. Minimisation is also assumed for external solvers
   that ignore the optimisation direction of the lp file (e.g. Xpress).


Exceptions
     5 --- EplexInstance does not a solver setup for it.
