EplexInstance:eplex_cleanup

   Destroy the external solver associated with EplexInstance.

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

    Destroy the specified solver, free all memory, etc.  Note that ECLiPSe
    will normally do the cleanup automatically, for instance when execution
    fails across the solver setup. The solver is disassociated with 
    EplexInstance, and any outstanding constraints not yet collected by the
    solver are removed, with a warning to the user. In effect, EplexInstance
    is reinitialised and can now be associated with a new solver without
    backtracking. Note that this last behaviour is unlike lp_cleanup/1, which
    also destroy the solver and disassociate it from the eplex instance (if 
    any), but does not remove any outstanding constraints.
