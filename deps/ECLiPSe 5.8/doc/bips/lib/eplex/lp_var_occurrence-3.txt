lp_var_occurrence(?Var, ?Handle, -Index)

   Returns the column number Index for Var in the external solver represented by Handle

Arguments
   Var                 Variable
   Handle              Handle to a solver state, or a variable
   Index               Column number for Var in Handle's matrix (integer)

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

    
    If Handle is a problem handle, then Index is the column number for the
    variable Var in the problem matrix of the external solver presented by
    Handle. If Handle is a variable, then the predicate returns the handles
    and index for each problem handle the variable non-determinately. 
    


Resatisfiable
   Yes (if Handle is a variable).
