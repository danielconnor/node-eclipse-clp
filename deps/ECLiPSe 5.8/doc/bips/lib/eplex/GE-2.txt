EplexInstance:(?X >= ?Y)

   Constrains X to be greater than or equal to Y.

Arguments
   X                   Linear expression
   Y                   Linear expression

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
	Logically: Constrains X to be greater than or equal to Y.
	X and Y are linear expressions.
	Operationally, the constraint gets delayed until the external
        solver state for EplexInstance is invoked.
