lp_var_get(+Handle, +Var, ++What, -Value)

   Obtain information for an individual solver problem variable Var.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state
   Var                 A solver problem variable for Handle
   What                Specification for information wanted (atom)
   Value               Returned value of What

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Retrieve information about solver state and results related to a
   particular variable or constraint, for the solver state represented by 
   Handle. Fails if no solution has been computed yet. What can take the 
   same values as those in eplex_var_get/3.

Exceptions
     4 --- Handle is not instantiated.
     5 --- Handle is not a compound term.
     6 --- What is not a valid value.
     6 --- Var is not a problem variable for Handle.
     6 --- What is unavailable; the information was not requested at solver setup.
