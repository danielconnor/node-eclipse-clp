lp_read(+File, ++Format, -Handle)

   Read a problem from a file and setup a solver for it.

Arguments
   File                File name
   Format              lp or mps
   Handle              Returns a handle to the new solver state

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Read a problem from a file and setup a solver for it.  Format is
   lp or mps. The result is a handle similar to the one obtained by 
   lp_setup/4. Note that minimisation of the objective is assumed 
   for mps format, as the sense of the objective is not included in 
   the mps format. Minimisation is also assumed for external solvers
   that ignore the optimisation direction of the lp file (e.g. Xpress).
   Note also that although quadratic problems can be read in correctly if
   supported by the external solver, the quadratic objective coefficients
   are not extracted from the problem by eplex. These coefficients are
   used to set/reset the objective when a problem is probed with a
   different objective in eplex_probe/2 or lp_probe/3, so the objective
   will not be changed or restored correctly in this case.
