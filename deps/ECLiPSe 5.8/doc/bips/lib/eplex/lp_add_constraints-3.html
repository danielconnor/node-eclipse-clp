<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
  Add new constraints (with possibly new variables) to a solver.
  NewIntegers is a list of variables that the external solver should
  consider as integers  The new constraints will be taken into
  account the next time the solver is run: if the new_constraint option of
  lp_demon_setup was turned on, then the solver will be invoked after the
  adding of the constraints.  The constraints will be removed on
  backtracking.
</P><P>
  The constraints are normalised and simplified before being passed to
  the external solver. If any constraint is ground, they are tested for
  consistency.
</P><P>
  Note that variables in NewIntegers can be any problem variables. In
  previous versions of ECLiPSe, there was a restriction that the variables
  be new problem variables; this restriction has been removed.

Any ground (no variable) or bound constraints (one variable) is self-inconsistent.
