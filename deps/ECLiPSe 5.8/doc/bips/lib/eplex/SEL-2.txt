EplexInstance:(?X $=< ?Y)

   Constrains X to be less than or equal to Y.

Arguments
   X                   Linear expression
   Y                   Linear expression

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
	Logically: Constrains X to be less than or equal to Y.
	X and Y are linear expressions.
	Operationally, the constraint gets delayed until the external
        solver state for EplexInstance is invoked.
        
        The $ version of the arithmetic constraints are provided to allow 
        code to be written which does not specify the solver. They are
        equivalent to their eplex instance counterparts without the $ prefix.
