lp_var_set_bounds(+Handle, ?Var, +Lo, +Hi)

   Imposes new bounds for Var on the solver state of Handle.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state
   Var                 A solver problem variable for Handle
   Lo                  New lower bound for Var (number)
   Hi                  New upper bound for Var (number)

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

    
    Imposes numeric bounds on the solver state of Handle for the variable
    Var. Each bound is only updated if it is more narrow than the current
    bound for the variable. The bounds are converted to floats before they
    are imposed, and no typing is implied by the type of the numbers. It is
    possible to impose incompatible bounds for the same variable on
    different solver states. Var must be an existing problem variable for
    Handle, i.e. it must occur in the constraints posted to the solver
    state. 

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Lo is greater than Hi.

Exceptions
     5 --- Handle is not in the form of a solver handle.
     6 --- Var is not a problem variable for Handle.
