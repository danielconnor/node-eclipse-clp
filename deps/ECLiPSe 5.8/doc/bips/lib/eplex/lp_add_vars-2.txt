lp_add_vars(+Handle, +Vars)

   Declare Vars to be problem variables for the solver state Handle

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state
   Vars                A list of variables or numbers

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Declares variables in Vars as problem variables for the solver state
   represented by Handle. Any of the variables that are not existing 
   problem variables for Handle are added to the problem. The new
   variables' bounds are constrained to -infinity..infinity (infinity as 
   defined by the external solver).


Fail Conditions
   Vars contain elements which are neither variables or numbers.
