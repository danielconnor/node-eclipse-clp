lp_release_license

   Release a runtime license token for the external solver.

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
    	The eplex-library interfaces to an external simplex/MIP solver
	which might require a license to run (e.g. CPLEX, XPRESS-MP).
	When the eplex-library is loaded, it tries to obtain a license
	immediately, or a license can be obtained by calling
	lp_get_license/0.  A held license can then be released using
	lp_release_license/0.  The predicate always succeeds, even
	if no license was held.
