EplexInstance:eplex_read(++Format,++File)

   Read a problem from a file into eplex instance EplexInstance.

Arguments
   Format              lp or mps
   File                File name

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

   Read a problem from a file and setup a solver for it in EplexInstance.
   A solver should not already be setup for EplexInstance. Format is lp or
   mps. Note that minimisation of the objective is assumed for mps format,
   as the sense of the objective is not included in the mps format.
   Minimisation is also assumed for external solvers that ignore the
   optimisation direction of the lp file (e.g. Xpress).  Note also that
   although quadratic problems can be read in correctly if supported by the
   external solver, the quadratic objective coefficients are not extracted
   from the problem by eplex. These coefficients are used to set/reset the
   objective when a problem is probed with a different objective in
   eplex_probe/2 or lp_probe/3, so the objective will not be changed or
   restored correctly in this case.  


Exceptions
     5 --- EplexInstance already has a solver setup for it.
