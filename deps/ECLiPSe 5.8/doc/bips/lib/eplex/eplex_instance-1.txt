eplex_instance(++EplexInstance)

   Initialises the eplex instance EplexInstance.

Arguments
   EplexInstance       Eplex instance name (atom)

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
  
  Initialises the eplex instance EplexInstance. An eplex instance is an
  instance of the eplex solver, to which eplex linear arithmetic and 
  integrality constraints can be posted, and to which an external LP/MIP
  solver can be associated and used to optimise the posted constraints
  with respect to some objective. 
  
  If EplexInstance is not an already existing eplex instance, a new eplex
  instance will be created and initialised. If it is an existing eplex
  instance, and it is not currently being used (having no outstanding posted
  constraints and no associated solver), it is effectively reinitialised.
  Otherwise, the predicate aborts with an error. Note that an eplex instance
  is a module, and each eplex instance can be associated with at most one
  solver at any time and vice versa. An eplex instance should NOT be
  erased (e.g. using erase_module/1), as this would only erase the module,
  but not the information that eplex keeps on it as an eplex instance.
