<H2>Description</H2>
    	The eplex-library interfaces to an external simplex/MIP solver
	which might require a license to run (e.g. CPLEX, XPRESS-MP).
	When the eplex-library is loaded, it tries to obtain a license
	immediately.  However, this might not be possible, either
	because no licenses are currently available, or because
	specific licensing information needs to be supplied.
    <P>
	In the latter case, lp_get_license/2 must be called explicitly
	by the programmer, and the relevant licensing information must
	be supplied as arguments.  The meaning of the arguments is
	specific to the solver used:
    <PRE>
                                LicStr          LicNum

        CPLEX development       unused          unused
        CPLEX runtime           licenvstring    serialnum
        XPRESS-MP development   xpress_path     unused
        XPRESS-MP runtime       xpress_path     response
    </PRE>
        If LicStr is a file or directory name, it is expected to be in
	the native operating system syntax.
