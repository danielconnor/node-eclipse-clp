Description

   Retrieve information about solver state and results for the solver state
   represented by Handle. ParamName is the same as that
   for eplex_get/2, which retrieves the same information via the EplexInstance.
   It can  be one of:



  
     vars
     Returns a term ''(X1,...,Xn) whose arity is the number of
         variables involved in the solver's constraint set, and whose
         arguments are these variables.


     ints
     Returns a list [Xi1,...,Xik] which is the subset of the problem
         variables that the solver considers to be integers.


     constraints_norm
     Returns a list of the problem constraints in normalised form.
         They may be simplified with respect to the original set that 
         was passed to lp_setup/4.


     constraints
     Returns a list of the problem constraints in denormalised (readable)
         form.  They may be simplified with respect to the original set
         that was passed to lp_setup/4.


     objective
     Returns a term min(E) or max(E), representing objective function
         and optimisation direction. E is a linear expression: any
         quadratic components will not be retrieved.


     num_cols
     Returns the number of columns (i.e. variables) in the matrix of the
     solver state.


     num_rows
     Returns the number of rows (i.e. constraints) in the matrix of the
     solver state.


     num_nonzeros
     Returns the number of non-zero coefficients in the matrix of the
     solver state.


     num_ints
     Returns the number of columns (i.e. variables) constrained to be
     integers in the matrix of the solver state.


     num_quads
     Returns the number of non-zero coefficients in the quadratic
     coefficient matrix (Q-matrix) of the solver state.


     method
     Returns the method that is specified to solve the problem. If an
     auxiliary  method can be given for the method, and this auxiliary
     method is not default, the method will be returned as 
     Method(Aux), e.g. barrier(none). The method will be 
     default unless otherwise specified by the the user (at setup or 
     via eplex_setup/2 or lp_setup/3).
     In case of MIP solving, this is the start algorithm (the one that 
     is used to solve the initial relaxation).


     node_method
     Applicable to MIP problems only. Returns the method that is
     specified to solve the problem at the nodes of the branch-and-bound
     tree. If an auxiliary method can be given for the method, and this
     auxiliary method is not default, the method will be returned
     as Method(Aux), e.g. barrier(none). The method will be
     default unless otherwise specified by the the user (at setup
     or via eplex_setup/2 or lp_setup/3).
     Note that the method for solving the root (initial relaxation) node
     is specified by method.


     status
     Status that was returned by the most recent invocation of the 
         external solver.


     cost
     Cost of the current solution.
         Fails if no solution has been computed yet.


     typed_solution
     Returns a term ''(X1,...,Xn) whose arguments are the properly
         typed (integer or float) solution values for the corresponding
         problem variables (vars).  The floating point solutions
         are the same as returned by solution, the integers are
         obtained by rounding the corresponding floating-point solution to
         the nearest integer.  To instantiate the problem variables to
         their solutions, unify this term with the corresponding term
         containing the variables:


    instantiate_solution(Handle) :-
        lp_get(Handle, vars, Vars),
        lp_get(Handle, typed_solution, Values),
        Vars = Values.



    slack

    Returns a list of floating-point values representing the constraint
        slacks. The order corresponds to the list order in
        constraints.  Fails if no solution has been computed yet.


    slack(Indexes)
    Returns a list of floating-point values representing the slack
        values for the constraints represented by Indexes. Indexes are 
        a list of constraint indecies (as returned by lp_add_constraints/4),
        and the order of the returned list corresponds to the order in
        Indexes.  Fails if no solution has been computed yet,
        or if the slack option was not set to yes.


    dual_solution
    Returns a list of floating-point values representing the dual
        solutions.  The order corresponds to the list order in
        constraints.  Fails if no solution has been computed yet.


    dual_solution(Indexes)
    Returns a list of floating-point values representing the dual
        solutions for the constraints represented by Indexes. Indexes are
        a list of constraint indecies (as returned by lp_add_constraints/4),
        and the order of the returned list  corresponds to the order in
        Indexes.  Fails if no solution has been computed yet,
        or if the dual_solution option was not set to yes.


    demon_tolerance
    Returns a comma-separated pair (RealTol,IntTol) of
        floating-point values which specify how far outside a variable's
        range an lp-solution can fall before lp_demon_setup/5
        re-triggers. The tolerances differ for real (default 0.00001) and
        integer (default 0.5) variables.


    simplex_iterations
    Returns the external solver's count of simplex iterations.


    node_count
    Returns the external MIP solver's node count.


    statistics
    Returns a list of counter values [Successes, Failures,
        Aborts], indicating how often lp_solve/2 was invoked on the
        Handle, and how many invocations succeeded, failed and aborted
        respectively.


    timeout
    Returns the time-out value for the solver state. This is the amount
        of CPU time in seconds that the external solver will be allow to
        spend solving the problem before timing out. The value is 0 if 
        no time-out has been set.

     optimizer_param(Param)
     Returns the value of the external solver's parameter Param
         for the problem represented by Handle. The external solver 
         has a number of parameters that affect the way they work, and 
         this queries their values. If Param is not a valid parameter for
         the solver, an out of range exception is raised. See below for 
         more details on the parameters.

    post_equality_when_unified
    Returns the value (yes or no) if an equality constraint will be
        posted to a solver if two variables in the solver's problem are 
        unified. 

    pool
    Returns the name of the eplex instance (if any) associated with 
        the solver state. Fails otherwise. Only useful if called with 
        lp_get/3.

    handle
    Returns the solver state handle (if any) associated with the eplex 
        instance. Fails otherwise. Only useful if called with eplex_get/2.


Note that reduced_cost, slack, dual_solution can only be retrieved
when previously requested in the option list of lp_setup/4 or with lp_set/3.


For the external solver's control parameter specified by
optimizer_param(Param), Param must be an atom. The Value returned is
either an integer, float or atom, depending on the parameter. The parameter
is generally specific to a solver and version, and also, they may be
problem specific, or global, again depending on the solver version. In all
cases, the value returned by lp_get/3 is the current value for the parameter
for the problem Handle. Refer to the solver documentation for details on the 
parameters. The names of the parameters are derived from the names of the 
parameters in the external solver. For CPLEX, take the parameter name from the CPLEX manual (or cplex.h), remove the CPX_PARAM_ prefix and convert the 
rest to lower case, e.g.


        CPX_PARAM_NODELIM becomes nodelim. 

For XPRESS-MP (version 13 and newer), take the parameter name from the 
manual (or xpresso.h), remove the XPRS_ prefix (if present) and convert 
the rest to lower case, e.g.

	MAXNODE or XPRS_MAXNODE becomes maxnode. 

    (pre version 13, the parameter names are prefixed by N_ instead of XPRS_).


    The following parameter names are additional aliases that work for
    either solver:

    crash
	CPX_PARAM_CRAIND (CPLEX) or XPRS_CRASH (XPRESS-MP) -integer
    feasibility_tol
	CPX_PARAM_EPRHS (CPLEX) or XPRS_FEASTOL (XPRESS-MP) - float
    integrality
	CPX_PARAM_EPINT (CPLEX) or XPRS_MIPTOL (XPRESS-MP) - float
    iteration_limit
	CPX_PARAM_ITLIM (CPLEX) or XPRS_LPITERLIMIT (XPRESS-MP) -integer
    node_limit
	CPX_PARAM_NODELIM (CPLEX) or XPRS_MAXNODE (XPRESS-MP) -integer
    objdifference
	CPX_PARAM_OBJDIF (CPLEX) or XPRS_MIPADDCUTOFF (XPRESS-MP) - float
    refactor
	CPX_PARAM_REINV (CPLEX) or XPRS_INVERTFREQ (XPRESS-MP) -integer
    scrind
	CPX_PARAM_SCRIND (CPLEX) or XPRS_OUTPUTLOG (XPRESS-MP) -integer
