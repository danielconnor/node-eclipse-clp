lp_get_license

   Get a runtime license token for the external solver.

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
    	The eplex-library interfaces to an external simplex/MIP solver
	which might require a license to run (e.g. CPLEX, XPRESS-MP).
	When the eplex-library is loaded, it tries to obtain a license
	immediately.  If this is not possible, for example because the
	license pool is temporarily empty, a warning is printed. The
	application program should then call lp_get_license/0 later
	to obtain a license before any eplex functionality is used.
	If a license is successfully obtained or already held,
	lp_get_license succeeds, otherwise it fails.
    
    	This predicate uses information from the file eplex_lic_info.ecl
	in the ECLiPSe library directory, or solver specific environment
	variable settings to locate the licensing information.
    

Fail Conditions
   Fails if no license can (currently) be obtained
