lp_cleanup(+Handle)

   Destroy the specified solver Handle and clean up.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

    Destroy the specified solver, free all memory, etc.  Note that ECLiPSe
    will normally do the cleanup automatically, for instance when execution
    fails across the solver setup, or when a solver handle gets garbage
    collected.  However, calling lp_cleanup/1 explicitly does not hurt and
    may cause resources (memory and licence) to be freed earlier.
