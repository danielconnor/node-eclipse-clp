     <DT><STRONG><TT>vars</TT></STRONG>
     <DD>Returns a term ''(X1,...,Xn) whose arity is the number of
         variables involved in the solver's constraint set, and whose
         arguments are these variables.

<P>

     <DD>Returns a term ''(X1,...,Xn) whose arguments are the properly
         typed (integer or float) solution values for the corresponding
         problem variables (<TT>vars</TT>).  The floating point solutions
         are the same as returned by <TT>solution</TT>, the integers are
         obtained by rounding the corresponding floating-point solution to
         the nearest integer.  To instantiate the problem variables to
         their solutions, unify this term with the corresponding term
         containing the variables:
         Fails if no solution has been computed yet.

<PRE>
    instantiate_solution(Handle) :-
        lp_get(Handle, vars, Vars),

        slacks. The order corresponds to the list order in
        <TT>constraints</TT>. Fails if no solution has been computed yet,
        or if the slack option was not set to yes.

<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>slack(Indexes)</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns a list of floating-point values representing the slack
        values for the constraints represented by Indexes. Indexes are 
        a list of constraint indecies (as returned by lp_add_constraints/4),
        and the order of the returned list corresponds to the order in
        <TT>Indexes</TT>.  Fails if no solution has been computed yet,

<P>

        solutions.  The order corresponds to the list order in

<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>dual_solution(Indexes)</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns a list of floating-point values representing the dual
        solutions for the constraints represented by Indexes. Indexes are

        floating-point values which specify how far outside a variable's
        range an lp-solution can fall before lp_demon_setup/5
        re-triggers. The tolerances differ for real (default 0.00001) and
        integer (default 0.5) variables.

<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>simplex_iterations</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the external solver's count of simplex iterations.

<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>node_count</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the external MIP solver's node count. Note that this may 
        or may not include the initial root node.
<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>statistics</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns a list of counter values <TT>[Successes, Failures,
        Aborts]</TT>, indicating how often lp_solve/2 was invoked on the
        Handle, and how many invocations succeeded, failed and aborted
        respectively.

<P>
    <DT><TT>timeout</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the time-out value for the solver state. This is the amount

<P>
     <DT><STRONG><TT>optimizer_param(Param)</TT></STRONG>
     <DD>Returns the value of the external solver's parameter Param
         for the problem represented by Handle. The external solver 
         has a number of parameters that affect the way they work, and 
         this queries their values. If Param is not a valid parameter for
         the solver, an out of range exception is raised. See below for 
         more details on the parameters.
<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>post_equality_when_unified</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the value (yes or no) if an equality constraint will be
        posted to a solver if two variables in the solver's problem are 
        unified. 
<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>pool</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the name of the eplex instance (if any) associated with

        lp_get/3.
<P>
    <DT><STRONG><TT>handle</TT></STRONG>
    <DD>Returns the solver state handle (if any) associated with the eplex 
        instance. Fails otherwise. Only useful if called with eplex_get/2.
<P>
</DL>
Note that reduced_cost, slack, dual_solution can only be retrieved
when previously requested in the option list of lp_setup/4 or with lp_set/3.

<P>
For the external solver's control parameter specified by
optimizer_param(Param), Param must be an atom. The Value returned is
either an integer, float or atom, depending on the parameter. The parameter
is generally specific to a solver and version, and also, they may be
problem specific, or global, again depending on the solver version. In all
cases, the value returned by lp_get/3 is the current value for the parameter
for the problem Handle. Refer to the solver documentation for details on the 
parameters. The names of the parameters are derived from the names of the 
parameters in the external solver. For CPLEX, take the parameter name from the CPLEX manual (or cplex.h), remove the CPX_PARAM_ prefix and convert the 
rest to lower case, e.g.

<PRE>
        CPX_PARAM_NODELIM becomes nodelim. 
</PRE>
For XPRESS-MP (version 13 and newer), take the parameter name from the 
manual (or xpresso.h), remove the XPRS_ prefix (if present) and convert 
the rest to lower case, e.g.
<PRE>
	MAXNODE or XPRS_MAXNODE becomes maxnode. 
</PRE>
    (pre version 13, the parameter names are prefixed by N_ instead of XPRS_).

    The following parameter names are additional aliases that work for
    either solver:
