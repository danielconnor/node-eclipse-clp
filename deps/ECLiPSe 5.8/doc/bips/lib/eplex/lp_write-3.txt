lp_write(+Handle, ++Format, +File)

   Write a solver problem to a file.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to an existing solver state
   Format              lp or mps
   File                File name

Type

Description

   Write the problem which corresponds to Handle to a file. The set of
   supported formats depends on the actual external solver which is used.
   All solvers support the mps format. Some solvers on some operating
   system platforms may change or append a suffix to the filename.
   Note that the mps format does not specify the sense (min or max) of the
   objective function.
