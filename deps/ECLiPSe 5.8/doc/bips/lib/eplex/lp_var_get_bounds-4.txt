lp_var_get_bounds(+Handle, ?Var, -Lo, -Hi)

   Returns the bounds stored in the solver state of Handle for Var.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state
   Var                 A solver problem variable for Handle
   Lo                  Lower bound for Var
   Hi                  Upper bound for Var

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

    
    Returns the numeric bounds stored in the solver state of Handle for the
    variable Var. The bounds are returned as floats. Var must be an
    existing problem variable for Handle, i.e. it must occur in the 
    constraints posted to the solver state. 

Resatisfiable
   no
