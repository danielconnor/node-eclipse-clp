lp_get(++ParamName, ?Value)

   Obtain the value of a global parameter.

Arguments
   ParamName           Atom
   Value               Variable, integer, float or atom

Type
   library(eplex)

Description
    Eplex have a number of global (i.e. not specific to a
    particular problem) parameters. These can be queried using this 
    predicate.

    optimizer
	Returns the name of the external solver, currently
	'cplex' or 'xpress'.
    optimizer_version
	Returns an integer derived from the version of the
	external solver.
    presolve
	Returns the default presolve setting for solver setup, i.e. the
        presolve setting that a solver state would be given if it was not
        directly specified during setup. The value is 1 if the default is
        to have presolve on, and 0 if off. Note that this is a change from
        previous versions of eplex, where this parameter is directly
        connected to the external solver's own presolve parameter. However,
        the solver may have more than one parameter for presolve settings,
        and these may take on more values than 0 and 1. In such cases,
        eplex will set the parameters(s) to some default value(s)
        corresponding to presolve being off and on. These parameters can be
        accessed directly using the optimizer_param option if required.
    timeout
        Returns the default time-out setting that a solver state would
        be given if it was not directly specified during setup. Value is
        0 if there is no time-out.
    standalone
        Value is `yes', as this is the stand-alone version of Eplex.
        as the external solver is used for keeping the bounds. This option
        allows programmer to write code that needs to distinguish between
        the stand-alone and the non-stand-alone versions of Eplex.
    optimizer_param(Param)
        Get the Value of the external solver's parameter Param.
        The exact behaviour and available parameters are dependent on the 
        external solver: if the external solver has only problem specific 
        parameters (e.g. XPRESS-MP 13 and later), this gets the default 
        setting that would be used for new problems; if the external solver
        has global parameters, this gets the global value for the parameter.
        If Param is not a valid parameter for the solver, an out of range 
        error is raised. See lp_get/3 for more details on the parameters.
