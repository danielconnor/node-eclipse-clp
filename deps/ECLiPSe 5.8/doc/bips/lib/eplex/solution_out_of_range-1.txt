solution_out_of_range(+Handle)

   A trigger goal for lp_demon_setup/5.

Arguments
   Handle              Handle to a solver state

Type
   library(eplex)

Description

  This is intended as a useful pre(Goal) for lp_demon_setup/5 in connection
  with the bounds trigger mode.  It succeeds if any of the
  solutions (computed by the most recent successful solving) of Handle are
  more than a tolerance outside the range of the corresponding variables,
  ie. couldn't be instantiated to this value.  The admissible tolerances
  can be specified in lp_setup/4 or lp_set/3 as demon_tolerance.
