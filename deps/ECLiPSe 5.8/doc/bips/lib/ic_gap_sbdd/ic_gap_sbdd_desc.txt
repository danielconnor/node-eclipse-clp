lib(ic_gap_sbdd)

   This library provides a GAP-based Symmetry Breaking via Dominance
   Detection (SBDD) library, as described in:

   Ian P. Gent, Warwick Harvey, Tom Kelsey and Steve Linton.  "Generic SBDD
   using Computational Group Theory".  In Francesca Rossi, editor,
   Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Principles and
   Practice of Constraint Programming - CP 2003, LNCS 2833, pages
   333-347.  Springer-Verlag, 2003.

   It has been enhanced by (amongst other things) being integrated with the
   symmetry expression library described in:

   Warwick Harvey, Tom Kelsey and Karen Petrie.  "Symmetry Group Expression
   for CSPs."  In Barbara Smith et al., editors, Proceedings of
   SymCon'03: Third International Workshop on Symmetry in Constraint
   Satisfaction Problems, a workshop of CP 2003, pages 86-96.
   September, 2003.

   This library is still being developed and is expected to evolve.
   Feedback, suggestions, problem reports, etc. welcome.

   Please note that this library currently does not work on Windows machines
   due to its dependence on the GAP interface library.
