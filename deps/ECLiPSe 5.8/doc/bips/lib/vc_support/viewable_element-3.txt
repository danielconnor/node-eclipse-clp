viewable_element(++ViewableName, ++IndexList, ?ViewableElement)

   Index a viewable element inside a viewable.

Arguments
   ViewableName        Atom: name of an existent viewable.
   IndexList           List of integers: the coordinates of the viewable element within the viewable.
   ViewableElement     Term to be unified with the viewable element.

Type
   library(vc_support)

Description
Note that this predicate throws an error if there are no current visualisation clients. Retrieves a single viewable element from a named viewable, given the element's array coordinates, and unifies it with ViewableElement. IndexList must be a ground list which has one positive integer for each dimension of the viewable.

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   ViewableName is not instantiated to the name of an existent viewable. ViewableElement will not unify with the specified element.

Exceptions
     1 --- There are no current visualisation clients
     4 --- ViewableName is not an atom or string
     5 --- IndexList is not a ground list of integers
     6 --- A co-ordinate in Index is out of range
     8 --- IndexList has the wrong number of elements
