lib(sicstus)


    ECLiPSe includes a SICStus Prolog compatibility package to ease
    the task of porting SICStus Prolog applications to ECLiPSe Prolog. 
    This package includes the C-Prolog compatibility package (lib(cprolog))
    and the Quintus-Prolog compatibility package (lib(quintus)). 
    
    Please note that this appendix does not detail the functionality
    of SICStus Prolog, refer to the SICStus Prolog documentation for
    this information. 
    
    The effect of the compatibility library is local to the module where
    it is loaded. For maximum compatibility, a Sicstus program should
    be wrapped in a separate module starting with a directive like
    
    :- module(mymodule, [], sicstus).
    
    In this case, Eclipse-specific language constructs will not be available.
    
    If the compatibility package is loaded into a standard module, e.g. like
    
    :- module(mymixedmdule).
    :- use_module(library(sicstus)).
    
    then Sicstus and Eclipse language features can be used together. 
    However, ambiguities must be resolved explicitly and confusion may
    arise from the different meaning of quotes in Eclipse vs Sicstus-Prolog.
    
    A sockets library is provided for compatibility with the sockets
    manipulation predicates of SICStus.  To use these predicates, the
    sockets library has to be loaded: 
    
    :- use_module(library(sockets)).
    
    For SICStus 3.0, the sockets predicates are also in a sockets library,
    so no changes are needed to load the library.  However, for older
    versions of SICStus, the predicates are available as built-ins, and no
    library has to be loaded.  So if the code is written for older
    versions of SICStus, then the above line has to be added. 
    
    The sockets library can be used independently of the sicstus library. 
    Note also that ECLiPSe also provides its own socket manipulation
    predicates that provides similar functionalities to the sockets library. 
    
    Since the SICStus package contains the Quintus one, the syntax
    differences are the same.
