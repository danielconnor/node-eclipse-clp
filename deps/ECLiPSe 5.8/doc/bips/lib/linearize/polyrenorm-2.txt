polyrenorm(+PolyOld, -PolyNew)

   Renormalize a polynomial form

Arguments
   PolyOld             Possibly denormal polynomial form
   PolyNew             Normalized polynomial form

Type
   library(linearize)

Description
	See polynorm/3 for the definition of the polynomial form.
	Such a form can become denormalized due to unifications
	(instantiation or variable-variable aliasing). This predicate
	renormalizes it.
    

Examples
   
    ?- polynorm(3*(X+Y),  Poly1, []), writeln(Poly1),
	Y = 3,
	polyrenorm(Poly1, Poly2), writeln(Poly2).

    [[[3, X], [3, Y]]]
    [[[9]], [[3, X]]]
