quadnorm(?Expression, -Const, -Linear, -Quadratic, -PolyRes, -Residue)

   Extracts constant, linear and quadratic part of an arithmetic expression

Arguments
   Expression          Arithmetic expression with constants and variables
   Const               Variable or number
   Linear              Variable or normalized linear polynomial
   Quadratic           Variable or normalized quadratic polynomial
   PolyRes             Variable or normalized superquadratic polynomial
   Residue             Residual nonpolynomial components in the form AuxVar=Expr

Type
   library(linearize)

Description
	This predicate is a simplified interface to polynorm/3 for the case
	where one is only interested in linear and quadratic components.
	See polynorm/3 for details.
    

Examples
   
    ?- quadnorm(2*5 + 3*(X+5*Y+7)*Z, Const, Lin, Quad, Poly, Res).
    X = X
    Y = Y
    Z = Z
    Const = 10
    Lin = [[21, Z]]
    Quad = [[3, X, Z], [15, Y, Z]]
    Poly = []
    Res = []
    yes.
