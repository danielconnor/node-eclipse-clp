linearize(?Expression, -Linear, -Residue)

   Split and arithmetic expression into linear and nonlinear parts

Arguments
   Expression          Arithmetic expression with constants and variables
   Linear              Normalized lists of monomials
   Residue             Residual nonlinear components in the form AuxVar=Expr

Type
   library(linearize)

Description
	The linear component of expression is normalised into a list
	(sum) of monomials of the form

		[C0*1, C1*X1, C2*X2, ...]

	where Ci are numbers and Xi are distinct variables.
	The first (constant) term is always present, Ci (i>=1) are nonzero.

	linearize/3 converts a general arithmetic expression into a
	normalised linear form. The nonlinear parts are extracted using
	auxiliary variables, and returned as Residue, which is a list of
	Aux=NonLinExpr constraints.

	linearize/3 understands all arithmetic expressions plus

	    lin(Lin)

	where Lin is an already normalised linear expression. All variables
	within Expression (which are free at linearization time) are taken
	to be numerical variables. If you intend to have variables which can
	be bound to symbolic expressions rather than numbers, they must be
	wrapped into an eval/1 functor.
    

Examples
   
    ?- linearize(3*X-7*Y+2*(X+Y), L, R).
    X = X
    Y = Y
    L = [0 * 1, 5 * X, -5 * Y]
    R = []
    yes.

    ?- linearize(12*3, L, R).
    L = [36 * 1]
    R = []
    yes.

    ?- linearize(X*(3+7*Y)-X, L, R).
    Y = Y
    X = X
    L = [0 * 1, 1 * _308, 2 * X]
    R = [_308 = X * (7 * Y)]
    yes.
