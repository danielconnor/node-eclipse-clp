register_option(++Name, ?InitialValue, +Options)

   Register an option

Arguments
   Name                Name of the option (any ground term)
   InitialValue        Initial value to be given to option
   Options             List of options related to this option

Type
   library(config_opts)

Description
   This predicate sets up an option with name Name and initial value
   InitialValue.  Name must be ground; InitialValue can be any term but
   should normally be ground, since it will be copied when stored and
   retrieved, which means that any retrieved non-ground value will contain
   fresh copies of variables rather than the original ones.

   Options must be a list.  The following terms may appear in this list:
   
   validation_pred(Pred/Arity)
       Pred is used to validate any value to be assigned to the option.
       This can be used to ensure that only legal values are assigned to the
       option.  Arity must be either 1 or 2, corresponding to the arity of
       the predicate to be called: if Arity is 1 then Pred(NewValue) is
       called, if Arity is 2 then Pred(Name, NewValue) is called; Name is
       the name of the option and NewValue is the value to be validated.  If
       the call to Pred succeeds then the value is assigned to the option;
       if it fails the value is not assigned.  Any choice points left by the
       call to Pred are pruned upon success.

       Only one validation predicate may be defined for any option; if more
       are specified then each replaces the one before it.

   notify_pred(Pred)
       Specifies that Pred(Name, OldValue, NewValue) should be called
       whenever the value of the option Name is changed.  OldValue is the
       old value of the option that has just been replaced and NewValue is
       the new value that has just been assigned.  Pred should not modify
       OldValue or NewValue in any way, as this may interfere with other
       notification predicates.  Note that any choice points left by the
       call to Pred are pruned upon success.
