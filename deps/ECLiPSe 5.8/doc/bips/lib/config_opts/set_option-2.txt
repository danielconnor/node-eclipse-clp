set_option(++Name, ?Value)

   Gives a new value to an option

Arguments
   Name                Name of the option
   Value               Value to be given to the option

Type
   library(config_opts)

Description
   This predicate gives a new value Value to the option with name Name.  The
   option must have already been registered with register_option/3.  If the
   option has an associated validation predicate (see register_option/3),
   then this is called before the option is given the new value, and if the
   validation predicate fails the value is not assigned and set_option/2
   fails.

   If the new value is successfully set, then any notification predicates
   associated with the option (see request_notification/2 and
   register_option/3) are called.

   The value set is persistent across backtracking.  Value is copied during
   setting, which means that if it is non-ground then it will contain fresh
   copies of variables rather than the original ones when retrieved later.
