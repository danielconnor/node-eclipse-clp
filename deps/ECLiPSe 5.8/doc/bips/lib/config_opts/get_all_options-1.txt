get_all_options(?OptionList)

   Retrieves the current values of all options

Arguments
   OptionList          List of (Module:Name)-Value terms

Type
   library(config_opts)

Description
   This predicate retrieves the current values of all options, returning a
   list of terms of the form (Module:Name)-Value, where Name is the name of
   the option, Module is the module that defined (registered) it, and Value
   is the current value of the option.

   The values are copied during retrieval, which means that if they are
   non-ground then they will contain fresh copies of variables rather than
   the original ones (or sharing with other retrieved copies).
