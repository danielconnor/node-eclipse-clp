biconnected_components(+Graph, -Articulations, -BCC)

   Finds the biconnected components of the graph

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   Articulations       a list of integer node numbers
   BCC                 list of lists of integer node numbers

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Computes the biconnected components of a graph, i.e. maximal subsets of
    the graph's nodes whose nodes are mutually accessible via at least two
    distinct paths (in other words, subgraphs which have no articulation
    points).

    Also compute a list of articulation points, i.e. those nodes that
    connect the biconnected components to each other.

    This operation is only defined for bidirected graphs.

    Note that by convention, isolated nodes and pairs of nodes connected
    by a single (bidirected) edge also form biconnected components.
