connected_components(+Graph, -ConnectedComponents)

   Computes the connected components of graph

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   ConnectedComponents a list of lists of node numbers

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Computes the connected components of a (bidirected) graph. Each resulting
    connected component is represented as an (unsorted) list of nodes.

    This operation is only defined on bidirected graphs.
    The runtime complexity is O(Nnodes + Nedges).
