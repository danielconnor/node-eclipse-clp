strong_components(+Graph, -StrongComponents)

   Computes the strongly connected components of a graph

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   StrongComponents    list of lists of integer node numbers

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Computes the strongly connected components, i.e. maximal subsets
    of the graph's nodes in which all nodes are mutually accessible.
    The implementation essentially uses Tarjan's algorithm with a
    complexity of O(Nnodes + Nedges).
