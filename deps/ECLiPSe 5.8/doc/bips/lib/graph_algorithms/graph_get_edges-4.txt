graph_get_edges(+Graph, +Source, +Target, -Edges)

   Finds all edges between source node and target node

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   Source              an integer node number
   Target              an integer node number
   Edges               a list of  e/3 edge structures

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    This operation is linear in the number of edges adjacent to Source.
