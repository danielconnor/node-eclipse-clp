graph_set_random_weights(+Graph, +Min, +Max)

   Unifies all the graph's edge data fields with random numbers

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   Min                 an integer or float
   Max                 an integer or float

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    The input Graph is assumed to be a graph with uninstantiated edge
    data fields. These will be instantiated to random numbers between
    Min and Max, using random/1 if Min and Max are integers, or using
    frandom/1 if Min and Max are floats.
