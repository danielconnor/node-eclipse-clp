critical_links(+Graph, -Links)

   Finds critical links in a bidirected graph

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   Links               a list of edge pairs (output)

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Finds all the critical links of a bidirected graph. We define an
    (bidirected) link as a pair of (oppositely directed) edges between
    two nodes. A critical link is one that, when removed, would make the
    graph more disconnected.
    
    The result is returned as a list of links, where each link is a
    hyphenated pair of e/3 edge structures like e(I,J,Dij) - e(J,I,Dji).
    

Fail Conditions
   Fails if the graph is not bidirected
