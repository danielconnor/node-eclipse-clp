graph_cycles(+Graph, -BreakingEdges)

   Computes a list of edges whose removal would make the graph acyclic

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   BreakingEdges       a list of e/3 edge structures

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Computes a set of edges whose removal would make the graph acyclic.
    This set is not necessarily minimal, and it contains an arbitrary
    edge from every cycle in the graph.

    If the list is empty, the graph is already acyclic.
