<H2>Description</H2>

    Tests whether SubGraph is a (non-strict) subgraph of SuperGraph.
    This is the case when the nodes and edges in SubGraph are a subset
    of the nodes and edges of SuperGraph. Note that nodes are considered
    identical when they have the same node numbers (rather than the same
    node names - node name information is ignored by this predicate.).
    
<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
SubGraph is not a subgraph of SuperGraph
