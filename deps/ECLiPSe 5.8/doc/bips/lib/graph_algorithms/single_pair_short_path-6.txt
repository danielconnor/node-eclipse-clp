single_pair_short_path(+Graph, +DistanceArg, +SourceNode, +SinkNode, +Tolerance, -Path)

   Computes short paths from a source to a sink node

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   DistanceArg         which argument of EdgeData to use as distance: integer
   SourceNode          source node number (integer)
   SinkNode            sink node number (integer)
   Tolerance           tolerable deviation from minimal length (non-negative number)
   Path                Length-EdgeList structure

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Computes shortest (or sufficiently short) paths from SourceNode to
    SinkNode. Alternative paths are generated on backtracking.
    Fails if there is no path at all.

    DistanceArg refers to the graph's EdgeData information that was
    specified when the graph was constructed. If EdgeData is a simple
    number, then DistanceArg should be 0 and EdgeData will be taken
    as the length of the edge. If EdgeData is a compound data structure,
    DistanceArg should be a number between 1 and the arity of that
    structure and determines which argument of the EdgeData structure
    will be interpreted as the edge's length. Important: the distance
    information in EdgeData must be a non-negative number.

    If DistanceArg is given as -1, then any EdgeData is ignored and
    the length of every edge is assumed to be equal to 1.

    If Tolerance is given as zero, all paths returned will have the same
    length and will be shortest paths from SourceNode to SinkNode.
    If Tolerance is nonzero, additional paths will be returned with
    lengths up to the length of the shortest path plus the tolerance.
    Note that the solutions are not generated in any specific order.

    A resulting path is returned as a Length-EdgeList structure where
    Length is the length of the path and EdgeList is the path in
    reverse order, i.e. starting with the edge reaching SinkNode and
    ending with the edge starting from SourceNode.
    

Resatisfiable
   yes

Fail Conditions
   There is no path from SourceNode to SinkNode

Examples
   
    ?- sample_graph(G), single_pair_short_path(G, 0, 1, 3, P).
    P = 2 - [e(2, 3, 1), e(1, 2, 1)]
