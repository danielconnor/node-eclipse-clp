<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
    Computes the biconnected components of a graph, i.e. maximal subsets of
    the graph's nodes whose nodes are mutually accessible via at least two
    distinct paths (in other words, subgraphs which have no articulation
    points).
<P></P>
    Also compute a list of articulation points, i.e. those nodes that
    connect the biconnected components to each other.
<P></P>
    This operation is only defined for bidirected graphs.
<P></P>
    Note that by convention, isolated nodes and pairs of nodes connected
    by a single (bidirected) edge also form biconnected components.
