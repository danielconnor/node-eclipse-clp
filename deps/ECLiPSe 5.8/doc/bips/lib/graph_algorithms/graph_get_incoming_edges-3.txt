graph_get_incoming_edges(+Graph, +TargetNode, -EdgeList)

   Returns a sorted list of all edges ending in TargetNode

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   TargetNode          an integer node number
   EdgeList            a list of e/3 edge structures

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Note on performance: By default, the graph structure only stores the
    outgoing (adjacent) edges of every node.  The incoming edge lists are
    computed lazily when graph_get_incoming_edges/3 is called for the first
    time (but then they are built for all nodes at once).  Therefore the
    first call to this predicate has O(NlogN) complexity, subsequent calls
    are only O(1). It may therefore make sense to do a dummy call to this
    predicate before starting time critical or nondeterministic computation.
