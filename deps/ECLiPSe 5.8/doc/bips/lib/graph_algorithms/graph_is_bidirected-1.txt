graph_is_bidirected(+Graph)

   Tests whether a graph is bidirected

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    A graph is bidirected if for every edge from S to T there is a
    corresponding edge from T to S. In case of loops (i.e. an edge
    from S to S) a second, different edge from S to S is required
    to satisfy the bidirectedness condition.
