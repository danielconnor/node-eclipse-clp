articulation_points(+Graph, -Articulations)

   Finds the articulation points of the graph

Arguments
   Graph               a graph structure
   Articulations       a list of integer node numbers

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Finds the articulation points of a graph, i.e. those nodes that,
    when deleted, would break the graph into two or more disconnected
    components. If there are no articulation points, the graph is
    called biconnected.

    This operation is only defined for bidirected graphs.
