is_sub_graph(+SubGraph, +SuperGraph)

   Succeeds iff SubGraph is a subgraph of SuperGraph

Arguments
   SubGraph            a graph structure
   SuperGraph          a graph structure

Type
   library(graph_algorithms)

Description

    Tests whether SubGraph is a (non-strict) subgraph of SuperGraph.
    This is the case when the nodes and edges in SubGraph are a subset
    of the nodes and edges of SuperGraph. Note that nodes are considered
    identical when they have the same node numbers (rather than the same
    node names - node name information is ignored by this predicate.).
    

Fail Conditions
   SubGraph is not a subgraph of SuperGraph
