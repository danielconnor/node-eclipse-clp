?Vars &:: +Domain

   All elements of Vars have a value in the domain Domain

Arguments
   Vars                variable or atomic value, list of them, or submatrix of them
   Domain              domain name (atom) or list of domain elements

Type
   library(ic_symbolic)

Description

	Constrains a variable, or a list or submatrix of variables, to be in
	the domain Domain.
	Domain must be the name of a previously declared domain (see domain/1),
	or a sub-domain, expressed as a list of values from a single domain.
	A domain variable can only be instantiated to values within its domain.
	
	Note that, on the left hand side of &::/2, the atom [] is not
	interpreted as the empty list but as a potential domain element.
	


Examples
   
    ?- X &:: weekday.
    X = X{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- [X,Y,we] &:: weekday.
    X = X{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}
    Y = Y{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- dim(M,[3]), M[1..3] &:: weekday.
    M = [](_306{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}, ...)
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- [X,Y] &:: [we,fr,su].
    X = X{[we, fr, su]}
    Y = Y{[we, fr, su]}

    ?- X &:: [].
    No (0.00s cpu)
