atmost(++N, +List, ++Value)

   Value occurs N times in List

Arguments
   N                   integer
   List                list of variables or domain values
   Value               domain value

Type
   library(ic_symbolic)

Description

	Constrains its arguments such that Value occurs at most N times
	in List.
	This is implemented by mapping onto ic_global:atmost/3.
	All list elements and Value must be variables or values of the
	same domain.  If one or more of them are domain-less, they will
	be given the same domain as the others.
