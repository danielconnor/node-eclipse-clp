Description

	Constrains its arguments such that Value occurs exactly N times
	in List.
	This is implemented by mapping onto ic_global:occurrences/3.
	All list elements and Value must be variables or values of the
	same domain.  If one or more of them are domain-less, they will
	be given the same domain as the others.
