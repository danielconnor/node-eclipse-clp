?X &= ?Y

   X is the same domain value as Y

Arguments
   X                   variable or domain value
   Y                   variable or domain value

Type
   library(ic_symbolic)

Description

	Constrains X and Y to be the same.  This is almost the same as
	unifying X and Y, except that &=/2 raises errors when X and
	Y are domain-less (where unification succeeds) or when the
	domains of X and Y are incompatible (where unification fails).


Examples
   
    ?- [X, Y] &:: weekday, X &= Y.
    X = X{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}
    Y = X{[mo, tu, we, th, fr, sa, su]}
    Yes (0.01s cpu)

    ?- th &= th.
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X &= th.
    X = th
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- fr &= th.
    No (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X &= Y.
    Arguments have no domains in X &= Y in module eclipse
    Abort

    ?- X &:: weekday, X &= red.
    Arguments have different domains (weekday,colour) in X &= red ...
    Abort
