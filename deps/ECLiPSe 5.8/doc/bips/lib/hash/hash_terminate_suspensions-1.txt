hash_terminate_suspensions(+Table)

   Wake and terminate all suspensions attached to the hash table

Arguments
   Table               Hash table

Type
   library(hash)

Description
Wake all suspensions attached to the hash table and close the
    	corresponding notification port. This informs the suspended goals that
	there will be no further notifications, and gives them the opportunity
	to clean themselves up.  This should normally be done once the hash
	table will no longer be used (or modified).
