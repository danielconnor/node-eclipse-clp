<H2>Description</H2>
	A solution of the goal <EM>Goal</EM> is found that minimizes
	the value of <EM>Cost</EM>.  <EM>Cost</EM> should be a
	variable that is affected, and eventually instantiated, by
	<EM>Goal</EM>.  Usually, <EM>Goal</EM> is the search procedure
	of a constraint problem and <EM>Cost</EM> is the variable
	representing the cost.  The solution is found using the branch
	and bound method:  as soon as a solution is found, it gets
	remembered and the search is continued or restarted with an
	additional constraint on the <EM>Cost</EM> variable which
	requires the next solution to be better than the previous one. 
	Iterating this process yields an optimal solution in the end.
	<P>
	The possible options are
	<DL>
	<DT><STRONG>strategy:</STRONG></DT><DD>
	    <DL>
	    <DT>continue (default)</DT>
	    	<DD>after finding a solution, continue search with the newly
		found bound imposed on Cost</DD>
	    <DT>restart</DT>
	    	<DD>after finding a solution, restart the whole search with
		the newly found bound imposed on Cost</DD>
	    <DT>step</DT>
	    	<DD>a synonym for 'restart'</DD>
	    <DT>dichotomic</DT>
	    	<DD>after finding a solution, split the remaining cost range
		and restart search to find a solution in the lower sub-range.
		If that fails, assume the upper sub-range as the remaining
		cost range and split again.</DD>
	    </DL>
	    The new bound or the split point, respectively, are computed
	    from the current best solution, while taking into account the
	    parameters delta and factor.
	    </DD>
	<DT><STRONG>from:</STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>number - an initial lower bound for the cost (default -1.0Inf)</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>to:</STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>number - an initial upper bound for the cost (default +1.0Inf)</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>delta:</STRONG></DT>	
	    <DD>number - minimal absolute improvement required for each step
	    (default 1.0), applies to all strategies</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>factor:</STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>number - minimal improvement ratio (with respect to the lower
	    cost bound) for strategies 'continue' and 'restart' (default 1.0),
	    or split factor for strategy 'dichotomic' (default 0.5)</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>timeout:</STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>number - maximum seconds of cpu time to spend (default: no limit)</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>report_success:</STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>GoalPrefix - an atom (predicate name) or structure (goal prefix),
	    specifying a goal to be invoked whenever the branch-and-bound
	    process finds a better solution.  The invoked goal is constructed
	    by adding three arguments (Cost, Handle, Module) to GoalPrefix.
	    Cost is a float number representing the cost of the solution found,
	    Handle is a handle as accepted by bb_cost/2 or bb_solution/2,
	    and Module is the context module of the minimisation.
	    The default handler prints a message.</DD>

	<DT><STRONG>report_failure:</STRONG></STRONG></DT>
	    <DD>GoalPrefix - an atom (predicate name) or structure (goal prefix),
	    specifying a goal to be invoked whenever the branch-and-bound
	    process cannot find a solution in a cost range.  The invoked goal
	    is constructed by adding three arguments (Cost, Handle, Module) to
	    GoalPrefix.  Cost is a From..To structure representing the range
	    of cost in which no solution could be found, Handle is a handle
	    as accepted by bb_cost/2 or bb_solution/2, and Module is the
	    context module of the minimisation.
	    The default handler prints a message.</DD>
	</DL>
	The default options can be selected by passing a free variable as
	the Options-argument. To specify other options, pass a bb_options-
	structure in struct-syntax, e.g.
	<PRE>
	bb_options{strategy:dichotomic, timeout:60}
	</PRE>
	In order to maximize instead of minimizing, introduce a negated
	cost variable in your model and minimize that instead.
	<P>
	Compatibility note: For backward compatibility, the report_success and
	report_failure options also accept Name/Arity specifications with
	maximum arity 3 for the handler goals. The three optional arguments
	are then Cost, Handle, and Module.
