<H2>Description</H2>
The comment/2 predicate allows documentational information to be added to
ECLiPSe modules which can then be extracted and processed automatically by
using the document tools in the document library.  Please note that any
reference to `comment' in the rest of this description means the comment
predicate, not the normal ECLiPSe comment (% and /* ... */).
<P>
Operationally, comment/2 always succeeds, so it is a no-op and is
ignored by ECLiPSe when executed. In order to be processed by the
document tools, it should appear as a directive in the program, i.e. as
<PRE>
:- comment(Type, Information).
</PRE>
A comment directive provides information on various aspects of the module
in which the comment occurs. The Type argument specifies what the aspect
is, and Information gives the information associated with that aspect. Some
restrictions should be observed to the placement of comments to allow automatic
processing to correctly process the comments. These are listed at the end.

The documentation generation tools and the tkeclipse library browser tool
make use of the comments to generate documentations for modules. They
recognise several comment types as specified by the Type argument and
extract the information accordingly.
The comments can occur in any order inside the module, and none
are compulsory; if they are missing, then the information they could have
provided is simply not used in the documentation generation. Most comment
type should only occur at most once per module unless marked *multiple* in
the following description. In the case of *multiple*, all occurrence of the
comments of the type are processed by the documentation tools. Otherwise,
only the first textual occurrence will be used.
<P>
The documentation tools recognise the following module-level comments:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>comment(summary, String)</STRONG>
   <DD>String is a short (one line) summary of the module.

<DT><STRONG>comment(desc, Description)</STRONG>
   <DD>Description is a longer Text (see below) describing the module in more
   detail than summary.

<DT><STRONG>comment(alias, String)</STRONG>                           *once* per file
   <DD>String is used to override the module name used by the document
   processing for the comments in the file. This allows the user to
   generate groupings of comments in the documentation other than the
   module in which the comments resides.

<DT><STRONG>comment(status, String)</STRONG>
   <DD>String is a single word, describing the status of the library.
   Classification used in ECLiPSe: prototype, evolving, stable, phase_out,
   deprecated.

<DT><STRONG>comment(author, String)</STRONG>
   <DD>String is the name of author(s) of the module.

<DT><STRONG>comment(copyright, String)</STRONG>
   <DD>String is the copyright notice that the documentation library will
   generate for the documentations it produce from the comments.

<DT><STRONG>comment(date, String)</STRONG>
   <DD>This is designed for version control.  String is a time-stamp
   for the file.  With CVS version control software, the string can
   initially be set to "&#36;Date&#36;", which will be expanded by
   CVS into the actual date each time the file is checked in.

<DT><STRONG>comment(include, FileNames)</STRONG>                      *multiple*
   <DD>FileNames is either one file name or a list of file names. The file
   name is either a string or an atom. These are names of files in which
   additional comments for the module are located. They are only processed
   by the document library tools.

<DT><STRONG>comment(index, ListOfStrings)</STRONG>
   <DD>The strings are used by the documentation generation process to provide
   pointers in the document index to the module: each string is added to
   the index pointing at the module description. This is used to add extra
   entries in the index in addition to the ones that are automatically
   generated.
</DL>
In addition, it is possible to comment individual predicates and
structures, using comment directives of the form:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>comment(Name/Arity, ListofProperties)</STRONG>            *once* for each Name/Arity
   <DD>Name and Arity are the specification for a predicate in the module and
   ListofProperties is a list of information for the predicate. The entries
   are described below.
   <P>
   Instead of a list of properties, the atom 'hidden' can be specified.
   This will prevent an undocumented, exported predicate from showing up
   in the generated library documentation.

<DT><STRONG>comment(struct(Name), ListofProperties)</STRONG>            *once* for each structure
   <DD>Name is the name of a structure and ListofProperties is a list
   of information for the structure.  The entries are described below
   (admissible properties are: summary, fields, desc, see_also,
   eg, index).
</DL>
In these comments, the ListOfProperties is a list of properties of the form:
<PRE>
    PropertyName: PropertyInformation
</PRE>
The properties can occur in any order in the list.
The following ones are recognized by the document tools:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>amode: FunctorTemplate</STRONG> *multiple*
   <DD>FunctorTemplate is a structure corresponding to the functor of
   the predicate with the argument filled in with the mode
   specifications.  The valid modes are those generally recognised by
   ECLiPSe (+, ++, -, ?).  This property can occur multiple times,
   each giving a different mode for the predicate.  The document tools
   will generate the multiple modes description in the detail
   description of the predicate, but will combine the modes by
   generalising all the amodes to general the general template for the
   predicate in any summary description of the predicate.

<DT><STRONG>args: ListofArgs</STRONG>
   <DD>ListofArgs is a list of the argument descriptions describing the
   argument. The length of the list should correspond to the arity of the
   predicate. The argument description is of the form:
    <PRE>
      ArgName: Description
    </PRE>
   where both ArgName and Description are strings. If present, ArgName will
   be used in the mode template.

<DT><STRONG>desc: Description</STRONG>
   <DD>Description is a Text (see below) giving a long description of the
   predicate.

<DT><STRONG>eg: Description</STRONG>
    <DD>Description is a Text (see below) for examples of using the
    predicate. This is used to generate the Examples section of the
    predicate description.

<DT><STRONG>exceptions: ListofErrors</STRONG>
   <DD>ListofErrors is a list of error description of the form:
    <PRE>
      Int: Text
    </PRE>
   where Int is a error code for an error that can occur with the predicate
   and Text describes the error. This is used to generate the
   `Exceptions' section of the predicate description.

<DT><STRONG>fail_if: Text</STRONG>
   <DD>Text is a string describing the fail conditions for the predicate. It
   is used to generate the `Fail Conditions' section of the predicate
   description.

<DT><STRONG>fields: ListofFields</STRONG>	*structures only*
   <DD>ListofFields is a list of the field descriptions describing the
   structure fields. A field description is of the form:
    <PRE>
      FieldName: Description
    </PRE>
   where FieldName is an atom or string and Description is a Text.

<DT><STRONG>index: ListofStrings</STRONG>
   <DD>Each string in ListofString will be added to the index generated by the
   document tools, pointing at the predicate. This is used to add
   additional index entries for the predicate in addition to the predicate
   names that is generated automatically.

<DT><STRONG>resat: Resatisfiable</STRONG>
   <DD>Resatisfiable is either yes or no, specifying if the predicate is
   resatisfiable. This is used to generate the `Resatisfiable' section of
   the predicate description.

<DT><STRONG>see_also: ListofSpecs</STRONG>
   <DD>ListofSpecs is a list of items, referring to other predicates and
   libraries which are related to the commented predicate. The specs can
   be of the form Name/Arity, LibName:Name/Arity, or library(LibName).
   This is used to generate the `See Also' section of the predicate
   description.

<DT><STRONG>summary: String</STRONG> *compulsory*
    <DD>String is a short (one line) summary of the predicate.

<DT><STRONG>template: String or list of strings</STRONG>
    <DD>This is normally not needed.  It is only useful to override
    the most general default template that will otherwise be
    automatically generated from the predicate name, the arguments and
    and the amode information.
</DL>
Note that only the 'summary' property is compulsory, and apart from
'amode', each property should occur at most once.
<P>
For the longer descriptions in the comments, a `Text' is allowed. 
This is either a normal ascii string or a string in a document markup
language.  In the latter case, the string must be enclosed in a
wrapper.  Currently the following are supported:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>html(String)</STRONG>
    <DD>String is in HTML format and can contain HTML tags.
    Special characters must be written using HTML notation.
    The string must be embeddable into an HTML document,
    i.e. there should be no &lt;html&gt; .. &lt;/html&gt; and
    no headings.
<DT><STRONG>ascii_fmt(String)</STRONG>
    <DD>String is in ascii format. It will be rendered using a proportional
    font and spacing and line breaks will be lost.
<DT><STRONG>ascii(String)</STRONG>
    <DD>String is in ascii format. It can consist of multiple lines
    and will be rendered using a fixed width font with all spacing and
    line breaks being preserved.
    (To break lines without inserting a significant line break,
    precede the line break with a '\').
<DT><STRONG>String</STRONG>
    <DD>The same as ascii_fmt(String), except in the 'eg' field
    where it is interpreted as ascii(String).
</DL>
In order to allow automatic processing, the following should be observed
with the placement of comments:
<UL>
  <LI> A comment should occur in a file.

  <LI> A comment must occur as a directive.

  <LI> A comment applies to a module, so it should occur textually inside
     a module, i.e. after any module declarations. If the program does
     not contain any module declarations, the file name (without suffix)
     is assumed to be the module.

  <LI> The file containing comments should only have a single module defined.
</UL>
Note that in addition to allowing automatic documentation generation, the
comment predicates can also be used to provide information on the module
itself when the user reads the program. Thus it can also act as comments in
the same way as the traditional comments, but in a more structured way.

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
None. Always succeed.
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
no
