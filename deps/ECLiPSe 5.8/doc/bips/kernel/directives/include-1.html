<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
     Include other file(s) for compilation as if the contents of those
     file(s) have been inserted in place of the directive. If more than
     one file is specified, they are included in the order in which they
     appear in the list FileSpec. 

</P><P>
     A compile/1 directive can also be used for recursive compilation.
     However, the semantics is different if the recursively compiled
     file contains any new module definition. With recursive compile, 
     those module end with the end of that file. However, with include/1, 
     the behaviour is as if the included file has appeared in place, and 
     so the new module will not end with the end of the included file.
     It is recommended that that include/1 should be used to include the
     compilation of different files in the same module, and compile/1 used
     to compile files that contain different modules.

</P><P>
     Currently, include/1 is implemented by a call to recursive compile, so
     it behaves like compile/1. This is to change in future releases. The
     documentation tools and fcompile assume that include/1 has the correct
     semantics described previously.
