coroutine

   Switches on the coroutine flag, equivalent to set_flag(coroutine, on).



Arguments

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Used to switch the global coroutine-flag to on.  This causes a subset of
   the built-in predicates not to raise instantiation faults any longer but
   to delay instead.  This concerns all sufficiently logical predicates
   like the arithmetic built-ins, functor/3, arg/3, and many others.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: X>0.
instantiation fault in X > 0
[eclipse 2]: coroutine.

yes.
[eclipse 3]: X>0.

X = X

Delayed goals:
        X > 0
yes.
