   Interval argument is unified with a float number indicating the timer
   interval in seconds.  The names of the timers are real, virtual and
   profile.




Resatisfiable

Fail Conditions

Exceptions
     4 --- Timer is not instantiated.
     5 --- Timer is not an atom.
     6 --- Timer is an atom not naming a timer.
     5 --- Interval neither a variable nor a float number.
