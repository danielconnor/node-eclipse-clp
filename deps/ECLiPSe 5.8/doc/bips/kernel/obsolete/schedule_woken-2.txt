schedule_woken(+SuspList, +Priority)

   Schedule all suspensions in the suspension list SuspList with the priority
Priority.



Arguments
   +SuspList           Suspension list or difference list or variable
   +Priority           Integer

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   This predicate is used to override the priority of all sleeping
   suspensions in SuspList and to schedule them with a new priority
   Priority.


   One possible use of this predicate is to postpone the execution of all
   suspensions in a list when they are known to succeed, to make sure that
   there will be no floundering goals and that the predicates are not
   executed too soon.  This is the case e.g.  when a variable is
   instantiated but this change should not be propagated to related
   constraints, because it is known to be redundant.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Priority is not instantiated.
     5 --- SuspList is not a list nor a difference list nor free.
     5 --- Priority is not an integer.
     6 --- Priority is less than 1 or greater than 255.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 4, S),
             make_suspension(writeln('hi there'), 2, T),
             schedule_woken([S, T]), wake.
hi there
hello

S = 'WOKEN GOAL'
T = 'WOKEN GOAL'
yes.
[eclipse 2]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 4, S),
             make_suspension(writeln('hi there'), 2, T),
             schedule_woken([S, T], 6), wake.
hello
hi there

S = 'WOKEN GOAL'
T = 'WOKEN GOAL'
yes.
