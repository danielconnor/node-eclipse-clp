current_stream(?Name, ?Mode, ?Stream)

   Succeeds if there is currently an open stream Stream open to the file Name
in the mode Mode. This predicate is obsolete, use current_stream/1 and
get_stream_info/3 instead.



Arguments
   ?Name               Filename (atom or string), contents of string stream                (string) or variable.
   ?Mode               One of the atoms read, write, update, string or a variable.
   ?Stream             Physical stream number (integer), or a variable.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Unifies Name with the file name and Mode with the mode of the stream
   Stream.  If Stream is a variable, it is bound to all open streams on
   backtracking.

   If the stream is not a file, the Name argument has different
   meanings:  If it is the user's console, the pseudo file names
   'user' or 'error' are returned.  If the stream is a string stream,
   Name returns the current contents of the string stream.

   The following table illustrates the predefined symbolic system streams
   with the name, mode, and initial physical stream number that they are
   initially assigned to.


    Logical         Name         Mode    Number
    input           user         read    0
    stdin           user         read    0
    output          user         write   1
    stdout          user         write   1
    warning_output  user         write   1
    log_output      user         write   1
    error           error        write   2
    stderr          error        write   2
    null            null         update  3


   Also see set_stream/2 for details on how to assign a symbolic stream
   name to a physical stream, or to redirect a symbolic stream name.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Stream is not a stream open to the file Name in the mode Mode.



Exceptions
     5 --- Name is instantiated, but not to an atom or a string.
     5 --- Mode is not an atom.
     5 --- Stream is instantiated, but not to an atom or an integer.

Examples
   
Success:
      current_stream(Name,Mode,Stream). % returns all
                                        %   open streams.

      [eclipse]: current_stream(error,Mode,Stream).
      Mode = write
      Stream = 2      More? (;)
      yes.

      [eclipse]: open(file,update,s), current_stream(file,M,s).
      M = update
      yes.

      [eclipse]: open(F,string(10),f), writeln(f, "bigstring"),
      > current_stream(Data,M,f).
      F = "bigstring\n"
      Data = "bigstring\n"
      M = string
      yes.

Fail:
      open(file,update,f), current_stream("file",M,f).
      current_stream(X,no,Y).

Error:
      current_stream(12,Mode,String).     (Error 5).
