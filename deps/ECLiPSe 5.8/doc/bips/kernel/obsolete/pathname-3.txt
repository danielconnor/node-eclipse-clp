pathname(+FilePath, ?Path, ?Name)

   If FilePath is a pathname of a file, succeed if Path is the pathname of its
parent directory and Name is the local file name.



Arguments
   +FilePath           String or atom.
   ?Path               Variable or string.
   ?Name               Variable or string.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   This predicate is used to decompose FilePath which is either a relative
   or absolute pathname of a file, into two components, namely the pathname
   of its parent directory including the trailing "/" if any, and the plain
   name of the file Name.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if FilePath does not unify with the concatenation of Path and
   Name.



Exceptions
     4 --- FilePath is not instantiated.
     5 --- FilePath is neither a string nor an atom.
     5 --- Path is neither a string nor a variable.
     5 --- Name is neither a string nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: pathname("/home/user/userfile", P, F).
      P = "/home/user/"
      F = "userfile"
      yes.

      pathname("/home/user","/home/").
      pathname("/home/","/home/","").
      pathname("home","","home").

Fail:
      pathname("/home/file","/home","file").

Error:
      pathname(F,P,R).                 (Error 4).
      pathname("/home/file",P,file)    (Error 5).
