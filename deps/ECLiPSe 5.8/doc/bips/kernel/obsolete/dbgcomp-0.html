<H1>dbgcomp</H1>
Tells the compiler to generate code with debug instructions.  Equivalent to
the call to set_flag(debug_compile, on).


<DL>
</DL>
<H3>This built-in predicate is obsolete!</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Only predicates that have been compiled with debug instructions can be
   traced by the debugger.

<P>
   The generation of debug instruction is switched on by default, and is
   only switched off using nodbgcomp/0 or else using
   set_flag(debug_compile, off).  This can be reversed using dbgcomp/0 or
   else using
   set_flag(debug_compile, on).

<P>
   Predicates that have been compiled without debug instructions cannot be
   traced by the debugger (only entering and leaving such a predicate can
   be shown).

<P>
   On the other hand, this code uses less space and runs slightly faster
   than code with debug instructions.  So it makes sense to compile
   well-tested predicates without debug instructions.

<P>
   Note however that predicates with debug instructions that are called by
   predicates without debug instructions are invisible to the debugger.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
      [eclipse]: dbgcomp, [user].
       p :- writeln(hello).
       user compiled 60 bytes in 0.02 seconds.
      [eclipse]: nodbgcomp, [user].
       q :- writeln(hello).
       % generated code is smaller
       user compiled 44 bytes in 0.00 seconds.
      [eclipse]: trace.
      yes.
      Debugger switched on - creep mode
      [eclipse]: p.
        (1) 0  CALL   p (dbg)?- creep
      B (2) 1  CALL   writeln(hello) (dbg)?- creep
      hello
      B (2) 1  EXIT   writeln(hello) (dbg)?- creep
        (1) 0  EXIT   p (dbg)?- creep
      yes.
      [eclipse]: q.
      N (1) 0  CALL   q (dbg)?- creep  % the inside of q/0
      hello                            % is invisible
      N (1) 0  EXIT   q (dbg)?- creep  % to the debugger
      yes.
