fail_if(+Goal)

   Succeeds if Goal cannot be satisfied.  Uses negation as failure (synonym of
not/1 and \+/1).



Arguments
   +Goal               Atom or compound term.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Used to fail if Goal succeeds.  Uses the standard Prolog form of
   negation as failure.


   To check whether a call Goal succeeds without binding variables, the
   call fail_if( fail_if( Goal)) can be used.


   Not that !/0 does not cut through fail_if/1.  Unlike not/1 and \+/1,
   fail_if/1 is a protected predicate and cannot be redefined.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Goal succeeds.



Examples
   
Success:
      fail_if(fail).
      fail_if(1 == 2).
      fail_if(X == 1).
      fail_if(fail_if(X = 1)).
          % does not bind X

Fail:
      fail_if(X = 1).
      fail_if(true).
      fail_if(3 == 3).
