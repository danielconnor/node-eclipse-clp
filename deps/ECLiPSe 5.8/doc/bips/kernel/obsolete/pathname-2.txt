   ?Path               Variable or string.

Type

Description
   Used to check if the pathname FilePath, when stripped of its file name,
   unifies with Path, the path up to the parent directory of the file.
   pathname(File, Path) is equal to pathname(File, Path, _).




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the pathname FilePath, when stripped of its file name, does not
   unify with Path, the path up to the parent directory of the file.



Exceptions
     4 --- FilePath is not instantiated.
     5 --- FilePath is not a string or atom.
     5 --- Path is neither a string nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: pathname("/home/user/userfile", P).
      P = "/home/user/"
      yes.

      pathname("/home/user","/home/").
      pathname("/home/","/home/").
      pathname("/home","/").
      pathname("/","/").

Fail:
      pathname("/home/","/").

Error:
      pathname(F,P).                   (Error 4).
      pathname('/home/user/',P).       (Error 5).
