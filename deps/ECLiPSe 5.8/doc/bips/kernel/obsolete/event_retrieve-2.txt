event_retrieve(+EventHandle, ?Goal)

   Given the handle with which an event is associated, retrieve the event goal.

Arguments
   EventHandle         An event handle
   Goal                A free variable or goal to unify

Type
   Obsolete

Description
	The goal associated with an event handle, created using event_create / 3, is
	retrieved using this predicate.
    
	Like event creation, retrieval of the goal produces a copy of the
	goal. As a result, if the goal contains variables, they lose their identity 
	and are replaced with fresh ones.
    
        If the event was disabled, the goal 'true' is retrieved instead of the
	original goal.
    

Resatisfiable
   No

Fail Conditions
   Goal does not unify with the event goal of EventHandle

Exceptions
     4 --- EventHandle is un-instantiated
     5 --- EventHandle is not a handle

Examples
       ?- event_create(writeln('Hello world!'), [], Event), event_retrieve(Event, EventGoal).

	Event = 'EVENT'(16'50421bd0)
	EventGoal = writeln('Hello world!')
	Yes (0.00s cpu)
