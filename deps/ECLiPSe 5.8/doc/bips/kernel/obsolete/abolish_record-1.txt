abolish_record(+Key)

   Remove the local record Key and all its recorded values.



Arguments
   +Key                Key specification of the form Name/Arity or just Name.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Remove the local record Key visible from the caller module and all its
   recorded values.  If global records are recorded under the key Key, they
   become visible to that module.


   Key is equal to Key/0.


   If there is no local key declared in the caller module (with
   local record/1), error 45 is raised.


   Note that abolish_record/1 is used to remove a records completely (even
   its local declaration) so that a global record (if any) becomes visible
   whereas erase_all/1 does not remove the local declaration.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Key is not instantiated.
     5 --- Key is not of the form Atom or Atom/Integer.
    45 --- No local key Key is declared in the caller module.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: record(type, integer). % global by default
      yes.
      [eclipse]: module(beer).
      [beer]: record(type, string).   % added global
      yes.
      [beer]: local record(type).     % define a local
      yes.
      [beer]: record(type, lager),
              record(type, stout).
      yes.
      [beer]: recorded(type, X).
      X = lager     More? (;)
      X = stout     More? (;)
      no (more) solution.
      [beer]: abolish_record(type/0).
      yes. % the visible is now the global one again
      [beer]: recorded(type, X).
      X = integer     More? (;)
      X = string     More? (;)
      no (more) solution.
