is_built_in(+PredSpec)

   Succeeds if PredSpec is a system built-in predicate.



Arguments
   +PredSpec           Term of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Used to test whether PredSpec is a ECLiPSe built-in predicate.


   This predicate only succeeds for a PredSpec which is known to be a
   built-in.  Undefined Predspec's raise an exception.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if PredSpec is not a built-in predicate.



Exceptions
     4 --- PredSpec is not fully instantiated.
     5 --- PredSpec is not in the format Atom/Integer.
    60 --- PredSpec is not a defined procedure.

Examples
   
Success:
   is_built_in(nl/0).
   is_built_in(write/1).

Fail:
   is_built_in(append/3). % append/3 is a library
                          % predicate, not a built-in.
Error:
   is_built_in(X).           (Error 4).
   is_built_in(a/X).         (Error 4).
   is_built_in(a).           (Error 5).
   is_built_in(1).           (Error 5).
   is_built_in(undefined/0). (Error 60).
