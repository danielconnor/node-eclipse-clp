<H2>Description</H2>
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe are executed in two stages:  first the suspension
   is processed by the waking scheduler which puts it into a global
   priority list where it waits until the wake/0 predicate is called by a
   predicate which is running with lower priority than the priority of the
   suspension.  The predicate schedule_woken/1 is the interface to the
   waking scheduler.  It accepts a list or a difference list of
   suspensions.  Executed suspensions are ignored, sleeping suspensions are
   inserted into the corresponding priority list.

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
[eclipse 1]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 1, S),
             schedule_woken([S]), wake.
hello

S = 'WOKEN GOAL'
yes.
[eclipse 2]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 255, S),
             schedule_woken([S]), wake.

S = 'GOAL'(writeln(hello), eclipse)

Delayed goals:
writeln(hello)
yes.
