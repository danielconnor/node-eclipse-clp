<H1>suspension_to_goal(+Susp, ?Goal, ?Module)</H1>
Succeeds for an unwoken suspension and returns the corresponding Goal
structure and caller module.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Susp</EM></DT>
<DD>A suspension.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>A variable or a callable term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Module</EM></DT>
<DD>A variable or a module.
</DD>
</DL>
<H3>This built-in predicate is obsolete!</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
   This built-in is used to access the contents of the abstract suspension
   data type.  It is complementary to make_suspension/2 as it returns the
   original goal structure and the module where make_suspension/2 was
   executed.  If applied to an already woken suspension it fails.

<P>
   Note that a suspension is not a standard Prolog data structure and can
   only be manipulated in a restricted way.  In particular, a suspension is
   not a term with functor 'GOAL' or 'WOKEN GOAL' although it is printed
   this way by default.  suspension_to_goal/3 is the only way to access the
   contents of a suspension.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if the suspension is already woken.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Susp is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Susp is not a suspension.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Goal is neither variable nor a callable term.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Module is neither variable nor atom.

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
[eclipse 1]: make_suspension(writeln(hello),S),
        suspension_to_goal(S, Goal, Module).
S = 'GOAL'(writeln(hello), eclipse)
Goal = writeln(hello)
Module = eclipse
Delayed goals:
        writeln(hello)
yes.
[eclipse 2]: make_suspension(writeln(hello),S),
        call_suspension(S),
        suspension_to_goal(S, Goal, Module).
hello

no (more) solution.
