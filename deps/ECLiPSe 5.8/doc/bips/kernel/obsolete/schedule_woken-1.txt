schedule_woken(+SuspList)

   Pass the suspension list SuspList to the waking scheduler.



Arguments
   +SuspList           Suspension list or difference list or variable

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe are executed in two stages:  first the suspension
   is processed by the waking scheduler which puts it into a global
   priority list where it waits until the wake/0 predicate is called by a
   predicate which is running with lower priority than the priority of the
   suspension.  The predicate schedule_woken/1 is the interface to the
   waking scheduler.  It accepts a list or a difference list of
   suspensions.  Executed suspensions are ignored, sleeping suspensions are
   inserted into the corresponding priority list.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- SuspList is not a list nor a difference list nor free.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 1, S),
             schedule_woken([S]), wake.
hello

S = 'WOKEN GOAL'
yes.
[eclipse 2]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 255, S),
             schedule_woken([S]), wake.

S = 'GOAL'(writeln(hello), eclipse)

Delayed goals:
writeln(hello)
yes.
