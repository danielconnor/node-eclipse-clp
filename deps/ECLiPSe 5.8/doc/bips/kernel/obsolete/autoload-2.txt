autoload(+Library, +ListOfPredSpec)

   Declares the predicates in ListOfPredSpec to be autoloading from the module
Library, which is in the file Library.pl in one of the library directories.



Arguments
   +Library            Atom.
   +ListOfPredSpecList of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Declares the predicates in the list ListOfPredSpec as defined in the
   file Library.  If any of the specified predicates is called, the system
   looks in the library_path directories for the file Library.pl, compiles
   it using lib/2 and then re-calls the predicate.  The file is supposed to
   contain a module_interface/1 or begin_module/1 directive at its
   beginning but it can be omitted and then Library is used as the module
   name.


   Predicates declared as autoloaded are always defined as global but note
   that the module directive in a file erases the module completely so that
   the autoloaded procedure (and its visibility) are removed completely
   before being recompiled.  This means that the global declaration must be
   present in the file.


   The predicate autoload_tool/2 is the same except that all the predicates
   are declared to be tools, using tool/1.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Library or ListOfPredSpec is not instantiated.
     5 --- Library is instantiated, but not to an atom.
     5 --- ListOfPredSpec is instantiated, but not to list a of    expressions of the form Atom/Integer.
   173 --- Library file Library.pl not found.  (when calling an    autoloaded predicate)

     yes.
     [eclipse]: p.  % p/0 is not an autoloaded pred anymore
     hello
     yes.
