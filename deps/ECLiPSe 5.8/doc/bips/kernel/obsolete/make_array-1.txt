make_array(+Array)

   Creates the untyped array or global variable Array.



Arguments
   +Array              Atom or ground compound term with integer arguments.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   If Array is an Atom, a global variable (visible from all modules where a
   local one of the same name is not defined) is created.  Its value is
   initialised to a free variable.


   If Array is a compound term, a global array of type prolog is created,
   its dimension is the arity of the term Array and the size of each
   dimension is specified by the corresponding argument of the term Array.
   The elements of arrays of type prolog are initialised to free variables.


Note
   make_array(A) is equivalent to make_array(A, prolog).




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Array is not ground.
     5 --- Array is not an atom or structure with integer arguments.
     6 --- The ground structure Array has arguments that are integers    not greater than 0.
    42 --- An array with the same name and dimension as Array already    exists.

Examples
   
Success:
      make_array(a(4)).
      make_array(b(2,3)).
      make_array(a(4)), make_array(a(4,1)).
      make_array(a), make_array(a(1)).

Error:
      make_array(X).                        (Error 4).
      make_array(a(6.0)).                   (Error 5).
      make_array(a(0)).                     (Error 6).
      make_array(a(-2)).                    (Error 6).
      make_array(a(4)), make_array(a(5)).   (Error 42).
