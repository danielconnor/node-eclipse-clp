Create an ECLiPSe event from an arbitrary goal.

<H3>This built-in predicate is obsolete!</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
	This creates an event from the goal provided, which can be raised 
	with the standard event handling predicates (e.g. event / 1, event_after / 2
	and event_after_every / 2) using the associated handle.
    <P>
	The event creation requires non-logical copying of the goal.
	As a result, if the goal contains variables, they lose their identity 
	and are replaced with fresh ones.
    <P>
	The intended use of such events are for localised event handling
	or when it is necessary to pass ground parameters to the event goal,
	i.e. when the use of a global event handler is unnecessary or does not suffice.
    <P>
	It should be noted that the event handle is the only way to uniquely
	identify a given event.  E.g. if an event has been scheduled as an
	after-event (using event_after/3 or events_after/2), it can only be
	cancelled by invoking cancel_after_event/2 with the correct handle.
