tool(+PredSpec)

   Declares PredSpec as a tool interface procedure.



Arguments
   +PredSpec           Expression of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   Informs the system that the (may be not yet visible) procedure PredSpec
   is a tool interface procedure.  Normally, tool(PredSpecI, PredSpecB) is
   used to define a tool interface procedure and declare its body.
   However, if PredSpecI is not yet declared as a tool and if the system
   has already compiled some calls to it, the tool/2 declaration will cause
   an error since the system cannot provide the caller's home module for
   calls which are already compiled.


   Therefore, when there are modules which are compiled before the tool/2
   declaration but which call PredSpecI, tool/1 should be used before the
   first call to inform the system that this is a tool interface procedure.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- PredSpec is not instantiated.
     5 --- PredSpec is instantiated, but not to an expression of the    form Atom/Integer.
    62 --- A call to PredSpec has already been compiled before the    tool declaration (``inconsistent procedure redefinition'').
