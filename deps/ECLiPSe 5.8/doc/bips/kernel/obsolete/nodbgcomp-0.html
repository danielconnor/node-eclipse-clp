<H1>nodbgcomp</H1>
Tells the compiler to generate code without debug instructions and not to
retain the source variable names.

<H3>This built-in predicate is obsolete!</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Only predicates that have been compiled with debug instructions can
   be traced by the debugger.  The generation of debug instruction is
   switched on by default, and can be switched off globally using
   nodbgcomp/0 or set_flag(debug_compile, off).  This can be reversed
   using dbgcomp/0 or set_flag(debug_compile, on).  This global
   setting can always be overruled on a file-by-file basis using
   pragma(debug) and pragma(nodebug) respectively. 

<P>
   Internals of predicates that have been compiled without debug
   instructions cannot be traced by the debugger (only entering and
   leaving such a predicate can be shown).  On the other hand, this
   code uses less space and runs slightly faster than code with debug
   instructions.  So it makes sense to compile well-tested predicates
   without debug instructions.  Note however that predicates with
   debug instructions that are called by predicates without debug
   instructions are also invisible to the debugger.

<P>
   Calling nodbgcomp/0 is equivalent to set_flag(debug_compile, off),
   set_flag(variable_names, off).

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.

Success:

       p :- q.
       user compiled 32 bytes in 0.00 seconds
      yes.
      [eclipse]: trace.
      Debugger switched on - creep mode
      yes.
