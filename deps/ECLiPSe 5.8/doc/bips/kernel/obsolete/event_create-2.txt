event_create(+Goal, -EventHandle)

   Create an ECLiPSe event from an arbitrary goal.

Arguments
   Goal                An arbitrary goal
   EventHandle         A free variable

Type
   Obsolete

Description
	This creates an event from the goal provided, which can be raised 
	with the standard event handling predicates (e.g. event / 1, event_after / 2
	and event_after_every / 2) using the associated handle.
    
	The event creation requires non-logical copying of the goal.
	As a result, if the goal contains variables, they lose their identity 
	and are replaced with fresh ones.
    
	The intended use of such events are for localised event handling
	or when it is necessary to pass ground parameters to the event goal,
	i.e. when the use of a global event handler is unnecessary or does not suffice.
    
	It should be noted that the event handle is the only way to uniquely
	identify a given event.  E.g. if an event has been scheduled as an
	after-event (using event_after/3 or events_after/2), it can only be
	cancelled by invoking cancel_after_event/2 with the correct handle.
