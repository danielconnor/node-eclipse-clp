cancel_after_event(?Event)

      Cancel all pending instances of after event Event.



Arguments
   +Event              Atom

Type
   Obsolete

Description
   All instances of the pending after event Event is 
   cancelled so that the event will not be triggered. A pending after event 
   is an event which is setup by either event_after/2, event_after/3 or 
   event_after_every/2, and which is waiting to be raised 
   (event_after_every/2 will always be pending as it is raised repeatedly).


   Note that the processing of an already raised, but as yet unprocessed
   event will not be cancelled by this predicate. 


   This is equivalent to

	cancel_after_event(Event) :-
	    cancel_after_event(Event, [_|_]).



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Event is not a pending after event.



Exceptions
     5 --- Event is not an atom.

Examples
   
   setup :-
      set_event_handler(hi, hi/0),
      event_after_every(hi, 3.2).

   hi :-
      writeln(hi).

   kill :-
      ( cancel_after_event(hi) ->
          writeln('event cancelled')
      ;
          writeln('no event to cancel')
      ).
