Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: open(file1,write,s), at(s, P1),
      > write(s, 1234567890), at(s, P2), close(s).
      P1 = 0
      P2 = 10
      yes.
      [eclipse]: open(file1,update,s), at(s, P1), read(s, T),
      > at(s, P2), close(s).
      P1 = 0
      T = 1234567890
      P2 = 10
      yes.
