set_stream_property(+Stream, +Prop, +Value)

   Sets the property Prop of the stream Stream to the value Value.



Arguments
   +Stream             Atom or integer denoting an open stream.
   +Prop               Atom.
   ?Value              atom, string or integer.

Type
   Stream I/O

Description
   Used to set various stream properties:



    Prop            Value         Description

    compress        on, off       a hint for output operations (e.g.
                                  write_exdr/2) to use a more compact
                                  output format (output streams only).
                                  Default: on (file,pipe,socket) or off.

    end_of_line     lf, crlf      which end-of-line sequence to write

    event           atom          event on writing to empty stream
                                  (see open/4)
    flush           flush,        explicit or implicit flushing
                    end_of_line

    macro_expansion on, off       expand term macros (input streams only)

    offset          integer       current position in the
                                  stream, same as seek/2

    output_options  list          default output options for all term
                                  output on this stream. The list
                                  format is as in write_term/2,3.

    prompt          string        prompt string (input streams only)

    prompt_stream   integer       output stream for the prompt
                    or atom       (input streams only)

    sigio           on, off       enable/disable SIGIO signals on
                                  this stream (UNIX only)

    yield           on, off       yield on end-of-file (see open/4)




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream, Prop or Value is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is neither an atom nor an integer.
     5 --- Prop is instantiated, but not to an atom.
     5 --- Value is of the wrong type for the given property.
     6 --- Prop is an atom, but not a settable property.
     6 --- Value is not recognised for the given property.
   193 --- Stream does not denote an open stream.

Examples
   
Success:
    set_stream_property(input, prompt, "hello: ").
    set_stream_property(Stream, flush, end_of_line).
    set_stream_property(Stream, end_of_line, crlf).
