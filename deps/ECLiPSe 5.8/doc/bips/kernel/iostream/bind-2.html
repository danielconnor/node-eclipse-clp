<H1>bind(+Stream, ?Address)</H1>
Associates an address with a given socket stream.

<H2>Description</H2>
   bind/2 is a direct link to the bind(2) system call, available on
   Berkeley systems.  Stream must be a socket stream created with socket/3.
   If the socket was created in the unix domain, Address must be an atom
   which identifies the file associated with the socket.  This file name
   can then be used by other processes to connect with this socket using
   the predicate connect/2.

<P>
   If the socket is in the internet domain, the address is in the form
   HostName/Port, where any of Address or HostName or Port may be
   uninstantiated.  When the port is already in use, the predicate raises
   an event and so it is always safest to call bind/2 with Address
   uninstantiated (this corresponds to the INADDR_ANY value for the system
   call), and upon success it will be instantiated to the hostname and
   selected port number.

<P>
   Stream sockets are connected using the standard sequence, i.e.
   socket/3, bind/2, listen/2 and accept/3 on the server and socket/3 and
   connect/2 on the client.  After the sockets are connected, both
   processes can use them for reading and writing.

<P>
   Datagram sockets require a connect/2 call from the process that wants to
   write on the socket and bind/2 from the one that reads from it.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Address is HostName/Port and HostName does not unify with the
   name of the host machine.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
