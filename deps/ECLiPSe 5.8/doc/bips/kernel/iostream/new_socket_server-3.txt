new_socket_server(?Socket, ?Address, ++Queue)

   Opens a new IP socket server stream with a maximum of Queue connections.

Arguments
   Socket              Socket server name (atom or variable)
   Address             Address for socket connection (Host/Port or variable)
   Queue               Number of connections allowed (integer)

Type
   Stream I/O

Description
    Opens a new IP socket server stream Socket at host Host and port number
   Port. It is allowed a maximum of Queue connection requests.


   This predicate combines the calls to socket/3, bind/2, listen/2 to
   create a socket server. After creation of the socket server, accept/2
   can be called to accept client socket stream connections. Socket is
   closed if either the bind/2 or listen/2 calls throws an exception and 
   thus a server socket cannot be made.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Examples
   

% Set up a socket server and accept a socket connection. The following will
% print the Port number used for the server, and waits for a client connection
[eclipse 26]: new_socket_server(Server, localhost/Port, 1), writeln(Port), accept(Server, _, Socket).
27694
....

% On a different ECLiPSe process running on the same machine (as localhost
% is used for the host name)

socket(internet, stream, Client), connect(Client, localhost/27694).

Client = 9
Yes (0.00s cpu)
[eclipse 3]: 
...

% On the original ECLiPSe process, the accept/3 call will now return
[eclipse 26]: new_socket_server(Server, localhost/Port, 1), writeln(Port), accept(Server, _, Socket).
27694

Port = 27694
Server = 9
Socket = 11
Yes (0.00s cpu)
% The Server can now be closed while the socket stream remains connected
[eclipse 27]: close(9).
