<H1>garbage_collect</H1>
Request an immediate garbage collection.


<DL>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Causes an immediate garbage collection of the global and trail stack,
   provided that the garbage collector is not switched off (cf.
   set_flag/2).  In any case the predicate succeeds.

<P>
   Note that the garbage collector is usually triggered automatically,
   controlled by the user-definable flag gc_interval.  Therefore, the usage
   of garbage_collect/0 should be restricted to situations where the
   automatic triggering performs badly.  In this case it should be inserted
   in a place where it is known for sure that a lot of structures and lists
   have become useless, eg.  just before a tail-recursive call as shown in
   the example.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
cycle(OldState) :-
    transform(OldState, NewState), /* long computation     */
    !,
    garbage_collect,               /* OldState is obsolete */
    cycle(NewState).
