Description
   This is a simple utility which uses file modification times to determine
   if a file needs recompilation.  All compiled files in the system are
   examined and recompiled if they have been modified since the previous
   compilation.  make/0 can be defined as follows:



make :- current_compiled_file(File, Time, Module),
        get_file_info(File, mtime) =\= Time,
        compile(File, Module),
        fail.
make.



Resatisfiable
      no

Fail Conditions
      none



Examples
