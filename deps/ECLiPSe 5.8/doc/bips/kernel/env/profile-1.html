Profile the goal and print the times spent in each predicate.

<DT><EM>+Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>Atom or a compound term.

<H2>Description</H2>
   This predicate invokes the profiler.  The profiler first executes Goal
   in profiling mode, which means that during its execution interrupts are
   generated at regular intervals and the profiler remembers the currently
   executing procedure.  When the goal succeeds or fails, the profiler
   prints so and then it prints the statistics about the time spent in
   every encountered procedure.  Goal can be any Prolog goal, it does not
   have to be compiled in a special profiling mode and no Prolog flags have
   to be set.  The time spent in simple predicates (i.e.  those with
   call_type prolog, written in C) is counted to their parent clause.
<P>
   In cases where the predicate name is not available, i.e. local goals in
   a locked module, then the information is grouped under a blank predicate
   name entry for the module.
<P>
   A temporary file /tmp/eclipse.prof.&lt;pid&gt; is used to store the profiling
   information and is removed upon exit.
