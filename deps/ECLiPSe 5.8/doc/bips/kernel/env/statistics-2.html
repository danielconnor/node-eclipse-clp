<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to retrieve various statistical information about the running
   ECLiPSe .  To print a list of all the current values, statistics/0 can
   be used.

<P>
   The following list details the statistic items:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>shared_heap_allocated</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of memory assigned to the code heap, i.e.
        the area used for storing compiled Prolog code, atoms, records,
        non-logical variables, descriptors, buffers etc.  This area will
        never shrink.

<DT><STRONG>shared_heap_used</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of memory currently used for compiled
        Prolog code, atoms, records, non-logical variables, descriptors,
        buffers etc.

<DT><STRONG>control_stack_allocated</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :  bytes

        control stack is allocated in chunks, up to a maximum controlled by
        the -l command line option. The local and control stacks share the
        same memory area specified by the -l option, which thus gives the
        maximum combined allocated size of these two stacks.

<DT><STRONG>control_stack_peak</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit : bytes

<P>
    Description :   The peak allocated size of the control stack during
        this session. Chunks of memory can be allocated to, and
        deallocated from, the control stack as it grows and shrinks.

<DT><STRONG>control_stack_used</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of control stack currently in use.  This

    Description :   Returns a list of two numbers: the length of the
        longest list in a hash table slot (i.e. the maximum number of
        dictionary entries that are hashed to the same slot), and the
        number of slots in the dictionary hash table.

<DT><STRONG>dict_gc_number</STRONG><DD>

<DT><STRONG>gc_area</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The average area processed by a garbage collection.
        This number should be close to the value of gc_interval.  If it
        is much higher, gc_interval should be increased.

<DT><STRONG>gc_collected</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The total number of bytes collected in the global
        stack during all the garbage collections in this session.

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of global stack currently allocated. The
        global stack is allocated in chunks, up to a maximum controlled
        by the -g command line option. The global stack and trail share the
        same memory area specified by the -g option, which thus gives the
        maximum possible combined allocated size of these two stacks.

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The peak allocated size of the local stack during

<DT><STRONG>local_stack_used</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of local stack currently in use.  This
        stack holds Prolog variables and return addresses.  

<DT><STRONG>memory, core</STRONG><DD>

<P>
   Unit :    List of bytes

<P>
   Description :   The second number is always zero. The first number is
       the total amount of memory currently allocated in the various

<P>
    Unit :   List of bytes

<P>
    Description : Returns a list of two numbers for the allocated shared
        heap, where, along with other items, program code is stored: the

        free. It is provided mainly for compatibility.

<DT><STRONG>global_stack</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of bytes

<P>
    Description : Returns a list of two numbers for the allocated global
       stack: the number of bytes currently used, and the number of bytes
       currently free. It is provided mainly for compatibility.

<DT><STRONG>local_stack</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of bytes

<P>
    Description : Returns a list of two numbers on the current usage of the
       allocated local and control stacks. In the original WAM, these two

       compatibility purposes only.

<DT><STRONG>trail</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of bytes

<P>

        currently free. It is provided mainly for compatibility.

<DT><STRONG>garbage_collection</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of numbers

<P>
    Descriptions : Returns a list that summaries garbage collections during
        this session: the number of times it has occurred, the number of
        bytes freed, and the total time spent (in seconds). This is
        provided mainly for compatibility purposes.

<DT><STRONG>runtime</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of milliseconds

<P>
    Description :   Returns a list of two times:  user cpu time since
        the start of the ECLiPSe session, user cpu time since the last
        call to statistics(runtime, _). As from ECLiPSe 4.2, these times
	exclude the time spent in garbage collection. This item is provided
        primarily for compatibility reasons.

<DT><STRONG>session_time</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   Seconds

<P>
    Description :   Returns the real time elapsed since the start of a
        (parallel) ECLiPSe session.  This is the only timer that can be
        reliably used in a parallel execution, since it accesses a
        central clock.  All other timers are local to the worker where
        they are accessed.

<DT><STRONG>times</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   List of seconds

<P>
    Description :   Returns a list of three times:  user cpu time,
        system cpu time and real time elapsed since the start of the
        ECLiPSe session.

<DT><STRONG>trail_stack_allocated</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description : The amount of trail stack currently allocated. The trail
        is allocated in chunks, up to a maximum controlled by the -g
        command line option. The global stack and trail share the same
        memory area specified by the -g option, which thus gives the
        maximum possible combined allocated size of these two stacks.

<DT><STRONG>trail_stack_peak</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description : The peak allocated size of the trail stack during
        this session. Chunks of memory can be allocated to, and
        deallocated from, the trail stack as it grows and shrinks.

<DT><STRONG>trail_stack_used</STRONG><DD>

<P>
    Unit :   bytes

<P>
    Description :   The amount of trail stack currently in use.  The
        trail stack records information needed for backtracking and is
        subject to garbage collection.
