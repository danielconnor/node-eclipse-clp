garbage_collect

   Request an immediate garbage collection.



Arguments

Type
   Development Environment and Global Settings

Description
   Causes an immediate garbage collection of the global and trail stack,
   provided that the garbage collector is not switched off (cf.
   set_flag/2).  In any case the predicate succeeds.


   Note that the garbage collector is usually triggered automatically,
   controlled by the user-definable flag gc_interval.  Therefore, the usage
   of garbage_collect/0 should be restricted to situations where the
   automatic triggering performs badly.  In this case it should be inserted
   in a place where it is known for sure that a lot of structures and lists
   have become useless, eg.  just before a tail-recursive call as shown in
   the example.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
cycle(OldState) :-
    transform(OldState, NewState), /* long computation     */
    !,
    garbage_collect,               /* OldState is obsolete */
    cycle(NewState).
