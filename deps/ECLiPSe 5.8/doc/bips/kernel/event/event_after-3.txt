event_after(+Event, +Time, -DueTime)

   Set up an event Event which is triggered at DueTime, after Time seconds have elapsed

Arguments
   +Event              Atom or Handle
   +Time               Positive number
   -DueTime            Variable, will be bound to a float

Type
   Event Handling

Description
   The event Event is raised after Time seconds of elapsed time from when
   the predicate is executed.  This is identical to event_after/2, except
   that DueTime gets bound to the time at which the event will be raised.
   This time can be compared to the the current event_time as returned by
   statistics/2.

   For more details, see event_after/2.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- Event is neither an atom nor a handle or Time is not a positive number.

Examples
   
    % With the following the handler definition
    report_due(DueTime) :-
	 Remaining is DueTime - statistics(event_time),
	 printf("Event is due in %w seconds%n", [Remaining]).

    ?- event_create(abort, E1),
	event_after(E1, 5, Due),
	event_create(report_due(Due), E2),
	event_after_every(E2, 1),
	repeat, fail.
    Event is due in 3.98999999999999 seconds
    Event is due in 2.98 seconds
    Event is due in 1.97 seconds
    Event is due in 0.959999999999994 seconds
    Aborting execution ...
