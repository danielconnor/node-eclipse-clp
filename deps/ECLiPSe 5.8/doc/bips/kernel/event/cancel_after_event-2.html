<H2>Description</H2>
   All instances of the pending after event Event is 
   cancelled so that the event will not be triggered. A pending after event 
   is an event which is setup by either event_after/2, event_after/3 or 
   event_after_every/2, and which is waiting to be raised 
   (event_after_every/2 will always be pending as it is raised repeatedly).
<P>
   CancelledEvents is the list of after events that have been cancelled. 
   Each element of CancelledEvents is of the form of an event specified
   in Events of events_after / 1. As a result, CancelledEvents can be
   reposted using events_after(CancelledEvents). If there was no event
   to cancel, CancelledEvents will be bound to the empty list.
<P>
   Note that the processing of an already raised, but as yet unprocessed
   event will not be cancelled by this predicate (but you can use
   event_disable/1 to achieve this).
