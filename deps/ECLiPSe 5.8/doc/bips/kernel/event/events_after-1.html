   Set up a series of after events Events.

<H2>Description</H2>
   Events is a list of after events where each element of the list
   specifies one after event. Each element is either in the form of
   EventName-Time or EventName-every(Time) where the first form is
   equivalent to event_after(EventName, Time) and the second to
   event_after_every(EventName, Time). The difference between using
   a single events_after/1 and multiple calls to event_after/2, 
   event_after/3 and event_after_every/2 to set up a series of after 
   events is that with events_after/1, all the events are set up as a 
   unit, and it is guaranteed that the relative orderings between the 
   events are preserved, and that no after events will be raised until
   all the specified events have been set up.
<P>
   The main use of events_after/1 is for restart event that have been
   cancelled previously with cancel_after_event/2.
<P>
   See event_after/2, event_after/3 or event_after_every/2 for more details
   on after events.
