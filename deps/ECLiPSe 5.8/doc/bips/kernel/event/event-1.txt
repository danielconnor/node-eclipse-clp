event(+EventId)

   The event EventId is raised and the corresponding error handler is
executed.



Arguments
   +EventId            Atom or event Handle, or a list of atoms and/or event handles.

Type
   Event Handling

Description
   The event EventId is raised and the corresponding error handler is
   executed.


   Other ways to raise events are by

   - one of the builtins error/2 or error/3.
   - posting an event from external code using ec_post_event().
   - an interrupt whose handler has been specified as event/1.

   The latter two have the effect of dynamically inserting an event/1
   goal into the current execution at the next synchronous point,
   which is usually just before the next predicate call.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the handler fails.



Exceptions
     4 --- EventId is not ground
     5 --- EventId is instantiated, but neither an atom nor an event handle, or a list of them
    32 --- No handler is associated to an atomic EventId

Examples
   
    ?- event(hello).
    warning: no handler for event in hello
    yes.

    ?- set_event_handler(hello, writeln/1).    
    yes.

    ?- event(hello).
    hello
    yes.

    ?- event([hello,hello]).
    hello
    hello
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
