current_after_events(?Events)

      Check or find currently pending after events.



Arguments
   Events              List of due / 2 structures or variable

Type
   Event Handling

Description

   If Events is a variable, then all the currently pending
   events are returned as a list. The list elements are of the 
   form due(EventName - PostTime, DueTime) for an event raised with
   event_after/2 and event_after/3 and of the form
   due(EventName - every(Interval), NextDueTime) for an event raised 
   with event_after_every/2. An event will appear as many times as it
   has been setup.   EventName is the name of the after event. PostTime is
   the time at which the event was posted, and DueTime the time at which it 
   is to be raised. For a repeating after event, Interval is the period
   between events, and NextDueTime is the next time at which it is to be raised.


   Note that this predicate simply returns a snapshot of the current pending
   after events. It is therefore possible that an after event returned in Events
   has already been raised.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if an element of Events is not a pending after event.



Examples
   
   setup :-
      set_event_handler(hi, hi/0),
      event_after_every(hi, 3.2).

   hi :-
      current_after_events(Es),
      writeln(hi),
      writeln('Pending events'-Es).

   % just spinning after the setup for events to be raised.
   ?- setup, repeat, fail.  
    hi
    Pending events - [due(hi - every(3.2), 30.51)]
    hi
    Pending events - [due(hi - every(3.2), 33.72)]
    hi
    Pending events - [due(hi - every(3.2), 36.93)]
    ...
