event_disable(+EventHandle)

   Disable the given event

Arguments
   EventHandle         An event handle

Type
   Event Handling

Description
	The given event is disabled.  A disabled events behaves as if its
	handler was the goal 'true':
	
	Retrieving the goal using event_retrieve/3 returns 'true'
	When the event is raised (e.g. posted via event/1), nothing happens
	If the event gets disabled after it was raised, but before its handler
	    execution has started, handler execution will be suppressed.
	
    
	Note that disabling and enabling events are nonlogical operations
	which are not undone on backtracking.
    
    

Exceptions
     4 --- EventHandle is un-instantiated
     5 --- EventHandle is not a handle

Examples
       ?- event_create(writeln(hello), [], E),
       event_disable(E), writeln(disabled),
       event(E),	% does nothing
       event_enable(E), writeln(enabled),
       event(E).
    disabled
