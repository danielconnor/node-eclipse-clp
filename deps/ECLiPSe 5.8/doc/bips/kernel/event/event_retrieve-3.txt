event_retrieve(+EventHandle, ?Goal, ?Module)

   Given the handle with which an event is associated, retrieve the event goal and module

Arguments
   EventHandle         An event handle
   Goal                A free variable or goal to unify
   Module              A free variable or module name

Type
   Event Handling

Description
	The goal associated with an event handle, created using event_create/3,
	is retrieved using this predicate. It also returns the context module
	in which the event was created (and where the goal should be called).
    
	Like event creation, retrieval of the goal produces a copy of the
	goal. As a result, if the goal contains variables, they lose their
	identity and are replaced with fresh ones.
    
        If the event was disabled, the goal 'true' is retrieved instead of the
	original goal.
    

Exceptions
     4 --- EventHandle is un-instantiated
     5 --- EventHandle is not a handle

Examples
       ?- event_create(writeln('Hello world!'), [], Event),
    	event_retrieve(Event, EventGoal, Module).

    Event = 'EVENT'(16'50421bd0)
    EventGoal = writeln('Hello world!')
    Module = eclipse
    Yes (0.00s cpu)
