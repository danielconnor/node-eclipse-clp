   Set up an event Event which is triggered after Time seconds have
   elapsed.

<H2>Description</H2>
   The event Event is raised after Time seconds of elapsed time from when
   the predicate is executed. Every call to event_after/2 will cause exactly
   one corresponding event, if the same event is requested several times, it
   will be raised several times. The event mechanism is safe with respect to
   backtracking: once an after-event has been requested, it will be raised,
   even when execution fails across the point where it was requested.
<P>
   Time can be a real number, but the actual granularity of how fine
   the elapsed time is measured is operating system dependent, and the
   triggering condition is actually that at least Time seconds have
   elapsed.
<P>
   In addition, the processing of an event may not happen immediately
   upon the raising the event, as events are processed synchronously:
   An event can only be handled at a point where an ECLiPSe goal can
   be executed. This can delay the handling of an event when ECLiPSe is
   performing some uninterruptible task, e.g. waiting for I/O, or executing
   external code.
<P>
   The use of after-events requires some thought because after-events can
   be raised at unpredictable (even though well-defined) points during
   program execution. As long as the handlers succeed, this poses no
   particular problem, because execution is allowed to continue after the
   handler succeeds. By design, the possibilities of an event handler to
   interact with the interrupted execution are limited (the handler can
   access global data structures, use a symbolic trigger, etc).
<P>
   More problematic are applications where the handler is allowed to
   abort using exit_block/1.  Due to the timed execution, the exact
   program point where the abort happens is unpredictable.  It must be
   made sure that the abort is safely caught in all cases, and that
   nonlogical data is not left in an inconsistent state.  In such cases,
   it is possible to use events_defer/0 and events_nodefer/0 to protect
   critical code sequences from being interrupted by event handling.
   Note that it never makes sense to let after-event handlers fail.
<P>
   Another problem that may occur with timed events is that a new
   event may be raised while another one is still being handled.  To
   stop event handlers from being interrupted by others, it is possible
   to give events the defer-property.  This means that event handling
   is automatically deferred on entering the event's handler, thus
   preventing other events from interrupting the handler.  Such handlers
   must always explicitly invoke events_nodefer/0 before exiting in order
   to reenable event handling.
<P>
   The timer used by measuring elapsed time is specified by the environment
   flag after_event_timer: virtual means that elapsed user cpu time is
   used, real means elapsed real time. The default is real. On
   systems that cannot support CPU time measurement, such as Microsoft
   Windows, one may not set the timer to virtual: an error is raised
   if this is attempted.  The time relevant for event handling can be
   obtained by calling statistics(event_time, Now).
