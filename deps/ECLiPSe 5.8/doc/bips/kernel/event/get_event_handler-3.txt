get_event_handler(+Event, ?Predspec, ?Module)

   Returns the event handler for event/error Event and its home module Module.

Arguments
   Event               atom or integer.

   Module              atom or variable.

Type
   Event Handling

Description
   Given the event name/error number Event, Predspec is unified with the specification
   (i.e.  a term of the form name/arity) of the current handler for 
   event; Module is unified with its home module.


   The events which exist are user defined; the errors which exist are
   implementation defined. 





Resatisfiable
      no.

Fail Conditions
      fails if Event is not an event.
 fails if Predspec or Module do not unify with the
	specification of the
   current event handler for Event.



Exceptions
     4 --- Event is not instantiated.
     5 --- Event is not an atom nor integer.
     5 --- PredSpec is neither a variable nor of the form Atom/Integer.
