Description
   This utility can retrieve information about any module that is currently
   loaded into the system. The information that can be requested is:

raw_interface (list of export/1 and reexport/1)
	this returns a list of all the export and reexport directives that
	occurred in the definition of the module and thus comprise the module's
	interface.
interface (list of export/1)
	Like raw_interface, but all reexports are replaced by the
	actual exports which result from them.
imports (list of modules)
	a list of the modules that have been imported as a whole.
locked (on/off)
	indicates whether the module is locked or unlocked.



Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Module is not instantiated.
     5 --- Module is not an atom.
    80 --- Module is not a loaded module.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: get_module_info(lists, X,Y).

X = raw_interface
Y = [export maplist / 3, export checklist / 2, ...]

X = interface
Y = [export reverse / 2, export subtract / 3, ...]

X = imports
Y = [eclipse_language]     More? (;) 

X = locked
Y = off
