Description

   The  multitasking control peer queue for Peer, created when the peer was
   registered  for multitasking, is closed. Peer will no longer be involved 
   in future multitasking phases.

   removed from the ECLiPSe side, any information on the external side is
   not touched. It is the responsibility of the external language interface
   to remove any multitasking information on the external side, before or
   after using this predicate.
