<H2>Description</H2>

    <P>
    This predicate completes the remote interface connection started by
    remote_connect_setup/3, which must be called before. The Peer and
    Socket arguments should be the same as those in the call to
    remote_connect_setup/3. 

    </P><P>
    This predicate will accept the remote socket stream connections
    according to the remote interface protocol described in the embedding
    and interfacing manual. Peer is the name of the new remote peer.
    TimeOut is used to specify the amount of time, in seconds, that the
    predicate will wait for the remote connection. If TimeOut is the atom
    block, then it will wait indefinitely for the connection from the
    remote process. The predicate will fail if the interval specified in
    TimeOut has elapsed while waiting for any of the connections with the
    remote side (including any subsequent peer queue connections).
    PassTerm is used for a simple authentication of the remote process:
    once the control connection is established, but before the rest of the
    creation of the ec_rpc link, the remote process must send a ECLiPSe
    term that matches (the comparison is performed using ==/2) PassTerm. If
    the terms fail to match, then the connection is closed and an out of
    range exception raised. The term is specified in EXDR format on the
    remote side. With the Tcl remote interface, the command to establish
    the connection sends a default PassTerm that is the empty string. This
    can be overridden by the programmer with a more complicated term.
    After establishing the connection, InitGoal will be executed to perform
    any user-defined initialisation on the ECLiPSe side, before any further
    interactions between the two sides. The result of executing the goal is
    passed back in InitRes; InitRes is set to fail and throw respectively
    if the goal fails or throws an exception.

    </P><P>
    The socket server Socket will be closed upon successful completion of
    the connection. It will also be closed if the predicate times out.

    </P><P>
    Once the connection is established, the optional user initialisation is
    performed on the ECLiPSe side before any further interactions. This is
    specified by InitGoal: If InitGoal is not a variable, it gives the
    goal that will be executed for the initialisation. If
    InitGoal is a variable, then no user initialisation is done before the
    two sides can interact. The result of executing the goal is returned in
    InitRes: the goal with its bindings if it was successful, the atom fail
    if the goal failed, and the atom throw if an exception occurred. 
    InitRes should be uninstantiated initially; otherwise, InitGoal will
    not be executed. 

    </P><P>
    After the optional initialisation, the remote interface is
    established. Initially, the remote side has control, and the predicate
    will block, and returns when the remote side hands over control.
 

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
     TimeOut second has elapsed without a connection request;
     Peer is not a remote peer name which is waiting to complete a remote connection.
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.

<DT><EM>(141) unimplemented functionality </EM>
<DD>The remote protocols of the remote and ECLiPSe sides are incompatible.
