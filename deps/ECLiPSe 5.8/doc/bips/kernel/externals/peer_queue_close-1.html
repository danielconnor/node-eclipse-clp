<H1>peer_queue_close(++Queue)</H1>
Closes the peer queue Queue from ECLiPSe side.
<DL>
<DT><EM>Queue</EM></DT>
<DD>Peer queue (atom or integer)
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   Close the peer queue Queue from ECLiPSe side. When this predicate
   returns, the peer queue would be closed on both the ECLiPSe and remote
   sides, and book-keeping information on both sides updated to exclude the
   queue. As with creating a peer queue, closing a peer queue is performed
   explicitly from one side only. 

<P>
   The user should not close a peer queue with close/1. This will only
   close the ECLiPSe end of the queue, and would not remove the
   book-keeping information. Note that peer_queue_close/1 will still remove
   the book-keeping information if some of the underlying streams
   associated with the peer queue are already unexpectedly closed.
