<H2>Description</H2>
   <P>
   If Property is a variable, this predicate will enumerate on backtracking
   all the properties of peer Peer. If Property is instantiated to a valid
   property name, the value of the property for Peer is unified with Value.

   <P>
   Property is one of the following:

<P>
<PRE>
   type     peer type (remote or embed)
   lang     peer language (currently "tcl" or "java")
   connect  connection information. Either:
               remote(LocalHost,PeerHost,TimeOut) or
               embed(Host,Host,block)
   queues   current peer queues (list of stream ids)
</PRE>
<P>
   'connect' returns the information on the connection for the peer. This
   information is mainly relevant only for remote peers, but is provided
   for the embedded peer for compatibility. The arguments for the remote 
   and embedded cases are equivalent, and are:
<PRE>
       LocalHost   Original local Host specification at peer creation
       PeerHost    Host for the Peer
       TimeOut     Time-out interval for creating new peer queues
</PRE>
   For remote peers, LocalHost specifies how the local hostname will be
   specified when setting up a connection between the peer and ECLiPSe.  It
   is the same as how the hostname was specified initially when the peer
   was set up: it can be either a variable, the actual hostname, or the
   special name 'localhost'. The specification may place restrictions on how
   the peer side client connection is specified. In particular, 'localhost'
   would restrict the peer to be on the same host as ECLiPSe.  PeerHost is
   either the hostname of the machine the peer is running on, or 
   'localhost'. TimeOut is the time-out interval (in seconds) for accepting
   peer queues, or the atom 'block' if there is no time-limit.
<P>
   The LocalHost and PeerHost are identical for the embedded peer, and is
   the hostname Host of the machine. There are no time-outs, so TimeOut
   argument is the the atom 'block'. 
   
   
<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
Peer is not a current peer; Property is not a valid property.
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
  Yes.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Peer or Property not of the right type.
