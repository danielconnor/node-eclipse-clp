peer_do_multitask(+Type)

   Perform a multitasking phase.

Arguments
   Type                User defined term (term)

Type
   External Interface

Description

   This predicate is intended for use only in implementing peer 
   multitasking for an external language interface.

   Multitasking is done within this predicate. That is, a multitasking 
   phase is initiated when the predicate is called, and when the multitasking 
   phase is finished, the predicate returns. If the abort exception is
   raised during the multitasking phase, the multitasking phase is properly
   terminated before the abort continues. 

   Type is a user defined term that is passed to all the multitasking 
   peers when the multitasking phase is initiated. This allows the 
   programming of different types of multitasking situations. Type must be 
   representable as an EXDR term.

   This is the only way to initiate multitasking, so if the user wishes to
   to initiate multitasking from a peer, they should call this goal 
   via an ERPC.

   During a multitasking phase, multitasking peers are each given a
   time-slice in round-robin fashion. They are allowed to perform ERPC
   during the time-slice. (More precisely: they are allow to execute
   peer-side code that contains ERPCs).

   To participate in peer multitasking, a peer should first be registered
   using peer_register_multitask/2. A peer can then initiate multitasking
   by calling peer_do_multitask/1 while the peer has control. The
   multitasking phase is started, and all registered peer will be informed
   during their time-slice that a multitasking phase has started. If the
   peer is interested in this particularly multitasking phase (as specified
   in Type), they should execute peer_multitask_confirm/0. The multitasking
   phase can be terminated by any peer by calling
   peer_multitask_terminate/0.
   

Exceptions
   peer_multitask_empty --- No peer is currently registered for multitasking.
