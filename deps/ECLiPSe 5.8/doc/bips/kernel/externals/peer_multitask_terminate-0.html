Terminate a peer multitasking phase.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   This predicate is intended for use only in implementing peer 
   multitasking for an external language interface.
</P><P>
   A multitasking phase is terminated by this predicate. That is, when this
   predicate is executed, then the end of the multitasking phase is
   initiated. ECLiPSe will then inform all the multitasking peers that
   the current multitasking phase is over. It is intended that this
   predicate be executed via an ERPC by a peer when it wants to initiate
   the end of a multitasking phase.
