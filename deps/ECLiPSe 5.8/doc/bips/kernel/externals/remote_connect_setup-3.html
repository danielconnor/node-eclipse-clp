<H2>Description</H2>
    <P>
    Set up the initial stage for a remote interface connection. This
    predicate type checks the arguments and creates a socket server at
    address Host/Port. This socket server will accept the socket stream
    connections from the remote process that is to be attached. The socket
    server stream is returned in Socket. Peer should be the name of the new
    remote Peer; if it is a variable, the predicate will assign a new name
    to the Peer. If Peer is an atom, the predicate will fail if Peer is an
    existing peer name (including names which has been created using
    remote_connect_setup/3, but not yet attached by remote_connect_accept/6).
    </P><P>
    When the predicate returns, the remote process can make its socket
    connections at Host/Port. The connecting request will suspend until
    they are accepted on the ECLiPSe side by calling
    remote_connect_accept/6. 
    </P><P>
    This predicate should always be followed by a call to
    remote_connect_accept/6, which completes the remote connection. The
    predicates are separated to allow the user to start the connecting
    request on the remote process. This can be done for example via exec/3.
    </P><P>
    If Host and Port are not initially variables, they must be valid for
    forming a socket connection. If Host is `localhost', then the remote
    connection would be restricted to the same host as the ECLiPSe process.
    </P><P>
    The predicates remote_connect_setup/3 and remote_connect_accept/6 are
    used to implement remote_connect/3. 

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
Peer is an existing peer name; Host or Port are not valid.
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
