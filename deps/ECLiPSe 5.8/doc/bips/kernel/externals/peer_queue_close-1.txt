peer_queue_close(++Queue)

   Closes the peer queue Queue from ECLiPSe side.

Arguments
   Queue               Peer queue (atom or integer)

Type
   External Interface

Description

   Close the peer queue Queue from ECLiPSe side. When this predicate
   returns, the peer queue would be closed on both the ECLiPSe and remote
   sides, and book-keeping information on both sides updated to exclude the
   queue. As with creating a peer queue, closing a peer queue is performed
   explicitly from one side only. 


   The user should not close a peer queue with close/1. This will only
   close the ECLiPSe end of the queue, and would not remove the
   book-keeping information. Note that peer_queue_close/1 will still remove
   the book-keeping information if some of the underlying streams
   associated with the peer queue are already unexpectedly closed.
   

Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
   Queue is not a current peer queue.

Exceptions
     5 --- Queue is not an atom or integer.
