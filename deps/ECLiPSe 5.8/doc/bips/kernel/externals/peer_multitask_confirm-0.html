<H1>peer_multitask_confirm</H1>
Confirm a peer multitasking phase.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   This predicate is intended for use only in implementing peer 
   multitasking for an external language interface.
</P><P>
   A multitasking phase is confirmed by this predicate. That is, when a
   multitasking phase is initiated by a call to peer_do_multitask/1, this
   predicate should be executed for the multitasking phase to continue. If
   this predicate is not executed, the multitasking phase will be
   terminated. It is intended that this predicate is executed via an ERPC
   by a peer when the multitasking phase is initiated, if that peer is
   interested in the phase. A multitasking phase will be ended when
   peer_multitask_terminate/0 is called.
