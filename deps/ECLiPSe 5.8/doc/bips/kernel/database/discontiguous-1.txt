discontiguous(++SpecList)

   Declares the procedure(s) specified by SpecList as discontiguous

Arguments
   SpecList            term of the form Atom/Integer, or a comma-separated sequence of such terms, or a list of such terms

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description
   The discontiguous declaration specifies that clauses for the declared
   predicate need not be together (contiguous) in the source file which contains
   them, but can be interleaved with clauses for other predicates. All clauses
   must be in a single file, though.

   A discontiguous declaration must textually occur in the same file and before
   any clauses for the predicate. Multiple discontiguous declarations for the
   same predicate are silently accepted.


Exceptions
     4 --- SpecList or a component of it is not instantiated.
     5 --- SpecList is instantiated, but not to a sequence or list of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.
    65 --- SpecList specifies a predicate which is already defined

Examples
   
  [eclipse 1]: [user].
   :- discontiguous(p/1).
   p(a).
   q(1).
   p(b).
  user       compiled traceable 220 bytes in 0.02 seconds
  yes.
