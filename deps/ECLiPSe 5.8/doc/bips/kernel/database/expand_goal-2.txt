expand_goal(+Term, ?TransTerm)

   Apply goal inline expansion to Term

Arguments
   +Term               A callable term.
   ?TransTerm          A variable or callable term.

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description
    Applies a goal inline expansion to Term, if any is visible in the
    caller module. If no inline declaration is visible, TransTerm is
    identical to Term.
    
    Normally, goal inline expansion is performed implicitly by the compiler.
    For certain meta-programming applications (e.g. for writing other
    compilers) it can be performed explicitly using expand_goal/2.


Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   None.

Examples
   
    [eclipse 1]: lib(fd).
    yes.

    [eclipse 5]: expand_goal(X#>Y, G).
    X = X
    Y = Y
    G = fd_arith : fd_gec(X, -1, Y, -1, 0)
    yes.
