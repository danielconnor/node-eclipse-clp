expand_clause(+Term, ?TransTerm)

   Apply clause transformation to Term

Arguments
   +Term               A clause term.
   ?TransTerm          A variable or term.

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description
    Applies a clause-transformation (clause macro) to Term, if any is
    visible in the caller module (see macro/3). If no transformation
    is visible, TransTerm is identical to Term.
    
    Normally, clause expansion is performed implicitly by the compiler.
    For certain meta-programming applications (e.g. for writing other
    compilers) it can be performed explicitly using expand_clause/2.


Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   None.

Examples
   
    % A grammar rule is an example of a predefined clause transformation:
    ?- expand_clause((p --> q, [tok]), C).

    C = p(_263, _258) :- q(_263, _278), 'C'(_278, tok, _258)
    yes.
