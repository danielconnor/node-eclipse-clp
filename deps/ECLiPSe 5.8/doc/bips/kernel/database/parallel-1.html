<H1>parallel +SpecList</H1>
Declares the procedure(s) specified by SpecList as parallel.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+SpecList</EM></DT>
<DD>Comma-separated sequence of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   The parallel annotation specifies that the system is allowed to execute
   the clauses of the annotated predicate in parallel (Or-parallelism),
   instead of sequentially by backtracking.  This has the following
   consequences:

<P>
  * the predicate is a source of or-parallelism which will hopefully speed
    up execution of the program on a parallel machine

<P>
  * calls to this predicate may return alternative solutions in
    unpredictable order

<P>
  * side effects within the parallel execution may happen in unpredictable
    order

<P>
   The parallel annotation has simply no effect when the predicate (or a
   particular call to it) is deterministic or when it is used with a
   sequential ECLiPSe system.

<P>
   A procedure can be declared parallel before it is actually defined.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>SpecList is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>SpecList is instantiated, but not to a sequence of    expressions of the form Atom/Integer.
</DL>
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
  [eclipse 1]: [user].
   :- parallel p/1.
   p(a).  p(b).  p(c).
  user       compiled traceable 220 bytes in 0.02 seconds
  yes.
  [eclipse 2]: get_flag(p/1, parallel, Flag).
  Flag = on
  yes.
  [eclipse 3]: p(X), use(X).
  % The three clauses of p/1 as well as the resulting goals
  % use(a), use(b) and use(c) may be executed in parallel!
