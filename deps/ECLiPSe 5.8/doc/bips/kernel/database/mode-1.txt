mode +PredModes

   Specifies the mode (calling pattern) for the given predicates.



Arguments
   +PredModes          Compound term whose arguments are +, ++, - or ?  or a comma-separated list of such compound terms.

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description
   The call of the predicate informs the compiler that the arguments of the
   specified predicate will always have the corresponding form when the
   predicate is called.  The compiler takes this information into account
   when the predicate is compiled and generates more compact and/or faster
   code.  Specifying the mode of a predicate that has been already compiled
   has no effect, unless it is recompiled.  If the specified procedure does
   not exist, a local undefined procedure is created.


   The possible argument modes are:



+   The argument is instantiated, i.e.  it is not a variable.

++  The argument is ground.

-   The argument is not instantiated, it must be a free variable without
    any constraints, especially it must not occur in any other argument and
    it cannot be a suspending variable.

?   The mode is not known or it is neither of the above ones.

   mode/1 is an operator and accepts also comma-separated list of mode
   specifications in the form



   mode p(+), q(-), r(++, ?).

   This operator binds less than comma, so the argument of mode/1 might
   have to be parenthesised when it is followed by other goals.  Modes for
   built-in and external predicates are ignored.  Modes are significant
   only for the first 15 arguments, for higher arguments the mode is always
   taken as ?.


   NOTE: If the instantiation of the predicate call violates its mode
   declaration, no exception is raised and its behaviour is undefined.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- PredModes is not instantiated
     5 --- PredModes is not a compound term or a comma list or its    arguments are not the above specified atoms.

Success:

    % no mode declarations
    [eclipse]: [append].
    /home/eclipse/src/append.pl compiled 212 bytes in 0.03 seconds

    % mode for one argument decreases the code size
    [eclipse]: mode(append(++, ?, ?)), [append].
    /home/eclipse/src/append.pl compiled 120 bytes in 0.00 seconds

    % modes for other arguments further decreases the size
    [eclipse]: mode(append(++, ++, -)), [append].

    no (more) solution.
