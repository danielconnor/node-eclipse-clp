lib(+LibraryName)

   Makes the library LibraryName available in the current module if not loaded
already.



Arguments
   +LibraryName        String or atom.

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description

   Used to load the library LibraryName into the system if it has not
   already been loaded.  The currently used Prolog suffix(es) is appended
   to LibraryName and the resulting library is loaded if it exists.

   The search path used when loading libraries is specified by the global
   flag library_path using the get_flag/2 and set_flag/2 predicates.  This
   flag contains a list of strings containing the pathnames of the
   directories to be searched when loading a library file.  User libraries
   may be added to the system simply by copying the desired file into the
   ECLiPSe library directory.  Alternatively the library_path flag may be
   updated to point at a number of user specific directories.

   lib(Lib) is identical to use_module(library(Lib)).



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- LibraryName is not instantiated.
     5 --- LibraryName is neither a string nor an atom.
    80 --- Library file does not contain a matching module.
   173 --- Library file LibraryName not found.
