current_compiled_file(?File, ?Time, ?Module)

   Succeeds if File is a file that has been compiled into the system.



Arguments
   ?File               Atom or variable.
   ?Time               Integer or variable.
   ?Module             Atom or variable.

Type
   Predicate Database and Compiler

Description
   This predicate enumerates all files that have been compiled during this
   ECLiPSe session.  Time is the modification time of the file at the time
   it was compiled, and Module is the module from where it was compiled
   (the latter is irrelevant if the file contains a module itself).  The
   information can be used to determine if a file needs to be recompiled.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- File instantiated, but not to an atom.
     5 --- Time instantiated, but not to an integer.
     5 --- Module instantiated, but not to an atom.

Examples
   
make :- current_compiled_file(File, Time, Module),
        get_file_info(File, mtime) =\= Time,
        compile(File, Module),
        fail.
make.
