read_string(+Delimiters, ?Length, ?String)

   Reads a string from the input stream up to a delimiter or up to a specified
length.



Arguments
   +Delimiters         String or atom.
   ?Length             Integer or variable.
   ?String             String or variable.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   A string of characters is read from the input up to one character which
   occurs in the delimiter string Delimiters.  This character is also
   consumed, but does not appear in the string which is unified with
   String.
   
   Two symbolic Delimiters can be specified:



    end_of_line   a newline or carriage-return/newline sequence
    end_of_file   the end of the file/input

   End of file always acts like a delimiter.


   If Length is a variable, it is unified with the length of the string
   String.  If Length is an integer, the number of characters read from
   the input is limited by the Length.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if String does not unify with the next string of characters read
   from input satisfying the described conditions.  The default handler for
   the error 190 also lets the predicate fail.



Exceptions
     4 --- Delimiters is not instantiated.
     5 --- Delimiters is not a string or atom.
     5 --- Length is not an atom or an integer.
     5 --- String is not an atom or a string.
     6 --- Delimiters is an atom but not a valid symbolic delimiter.
   190 --- End of file was encountered before reading any character.
   198 --- Trying to read even after the error 190 was raised.

Examples
      Equivalent to read_string(input, Delimiters, Length, String).  (see
   read_string/4 for details).
