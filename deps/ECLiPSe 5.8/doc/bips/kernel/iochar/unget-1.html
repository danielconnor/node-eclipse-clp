<H1>unget(+Stream)</H1>
Back up one character on Stream
<DL>
<DT><EM>+Stream</EM></DT>
<DD>Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
    Go back one character on the given Stream. This can be used to
    implement lookaheads.
    <P>
    The number of characters that can be reliably ungotten is 4, and the
    result is only defined if these characters have been read previously.
    <P>
    The result of the operation is undefined if
    <UL>
    <LI>trying to unget more than 4 characters
    <LI>trying to unget more characters than had been read previously
    <LI>trying to unget after a seek operation
    </UL>
    In these cases, unget/1 will succeed, but subsequent read operations
    will return undefined results.

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
None
<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Stream is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Stream is neither an integer nor an atom.
<DT><EM>(192) illegal stream mode </EM>
<DD>Stream not in read mode.
