<H1>tyi(?Ascii)</H1>
Succeeds if the ascii code of the next character read in raw mode from the
current input is successfully unified with Ascii.


<DL>
<DT><EM>?Ascii</EM></DT>
<DD>Integer.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Takes the next character from the current input and unifies its integer
   ASCII code (in the range 0 to 255) with Ascii.  The input is in raw mode
   so that no newline character must be typed.

<P>
   ASCII codes for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters)
   are also acceptable.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Ascii does not unify with the next character from the current
   input.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.
<DT><EM>(190) end of file reached </EM>
<DD>End of file was encountered before reading any character.
<DT><EM>(198) reading past the file end </EM>
<DD>Trying to read even after the error 190 was raised.
</DL>
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>   Equivalent to tyi(input, Ascii).  (see tyi/2 for details).
