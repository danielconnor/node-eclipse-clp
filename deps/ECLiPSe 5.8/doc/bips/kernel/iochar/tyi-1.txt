tyi(?Ascii)

   Succeeds if the ascii code of the next character read in raw mode from the
current input is successfully unified with Ascii.



Arguments
   ?Ascii              Integer.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   Takes the next character from the current input and unifies its integer
   ASCII code (in the range 0 to 255) with Ascii.  The input is in raw mode
   so that no newline character must be typed.


   ASCII codes for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters)
   are also acceptable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Ascii does not unify with the next character from the current
   input.



Exceptions
     5 --- Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.
   190 --- End of file was encountered before reading any character.
   198 --- Trying to read even after the error 190 was raised.

Examples
      Equivalent to tyi(input, Ascii).  (see tyi/2 for details).
