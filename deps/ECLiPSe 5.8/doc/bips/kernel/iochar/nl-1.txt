nl(+Stream)

   A newline is printed on the output stream Stream.

Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).

Type
   Character I/O

Description
	Used to print a newline sequence on the output stream Stream.
	The exact character sequence emitted depends on the setting of
	the stream's end_of_line flag (lf or crlf).
	In addition, if the stream's flush flag is set to
	end_of_line, the stream is also flushed.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is neither an atom nor a number.
   192 --- Stream is not an output stream.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.
