get(+Stream, ?Ascii)

   Reads the next character from the input stream Stream and unifies its ASCII
code with Ascii.



Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
   ?Ascii              Integer.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   Takes the next character from the open input stream Stream and unifies
   its integer ASCII code (in the range 0 to 255) to Ascii.  ASCII codes
   for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters) are also
   acceptable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Ascii does not unify with the next character from the buffered
   input stream Stream.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is neither an integer nor an atom.
     5 --- Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.
   190 --- End of file has been reached.
   192 --- Stream is not an input stream.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: get(input, 0'a),get(input,97).
      > aa
      yes.
Fail:
      [eclipse]: get(input,98).
      > a
      no.
Error:
      get(Stream,98).                 (Error 4).
      get(input, '98').               (Error 5).
      get(10,A).                      (Error 192).
      get(atom,A).                    (Error 193).
