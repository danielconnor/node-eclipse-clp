put(+Stream, +Ascii)

   The character represented by the ascii integer code Ascii is put onto the
buffered output stream Stream.



Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
   +Ascii              Integer.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   Puts the character represented by the integer ASCII code Ascii (in the
   range 0 to 255) onto the buffered output stream Stream.


   The output from put/2 is buffered first, and is only output to the
   stream when the output is flushed (e.g.  using flush/1).


   ASCII codes for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters)
   are also acceptable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     4 --- Ascii is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is neither an integer nor an atom.
     5 --- Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.
   192 --- Stream is not an output stream.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.
