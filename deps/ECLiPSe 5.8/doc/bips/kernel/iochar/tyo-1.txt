tyo(+Ascii)

   The character represented by the ascii integer Ascii is put onto the
current output in raw mode.



Arguments
   +Ascii              Integer.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   Puts the character represented by the integer ASCII code Ascii (in the
   range 0 to 255) onto the current output in raw mode.


   If the output device is a terminal, the tyo/1 output goes directly to
   the screen, whereas the output from put/1 is buffered first, and is only
   output to the screen when the current output is flushed (e.g.
   explicitly using flush(1).).


   ASCII codes for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters)
   are also acceptable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Ascii is not instantiated.
     5 --- Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.

Examples
      Equivalent to tyo(output, Ascii).  (see tyo/2 for details).
