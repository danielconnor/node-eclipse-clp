tyo(+Stream, +Ascii)

   The character represented by the ascii integer Ascii is put onto the output
stream Stream in raw mode.



Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
   +Ascii              Integer.

Type
   Character I/O

Description
   Puts the character represented by the integer ASCII code Ascii (in the
   range 0 to 255) onto the output stream Stream in raw mode.


   If the stream is a terminal, the tyo/2 output goes directly to the
   stream, whereas the output from put/2 is buffered first, and is only
   output to the stream when the output is flushed (e.g.  explicitly using
   flush/1).


   If the stream is not a terminal, tyo/2 behaves like put/2.


   ASCII codes for the non-printable characters (i.e.  control characters)
   are also acceptable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     4 --- Ascii is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is neither an integer nor an atom.
     5 --- Ascii is instantiated, but not to an integer.
   192 --- Stream is not an output stream.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.
