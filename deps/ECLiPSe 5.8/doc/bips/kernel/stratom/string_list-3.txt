string_list(?String, ?List, +Format)

   Conversion between string in different encodings and a character list

Arguments
   ?String             String or variable.
   ?List               A variable or a list of integers and/or variables.
   +Format             An atom.

Type
   Strings and Atoms

Description
   This predicate performs conversion between a string encoded in Format
   and a list of the corresponding character codes.

   If String is instantiated, it is must be a valid string in the encoding
   format specified by Format.  It is then decoded and List is unified with
   a list of the corresponding character codes.

   If List is instantiated, it is must contain character codes that are
   valid for the encoding format specified by Format.  These characters
   are then encoded into a string which is unified with String.

   Currently supported formats are:

bytes
    every byte in the string corresponds to a list integer in the range 0..255.
utf8
    the string is encoded in UTF-8 format and the list can contain integers
    in the range 0..2^31-1.


   Note that string_list/2 can be defined as:

	string_list(S, L) :- string_list(S, L, bytes).



Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   None

Exceptions
     4 --- Format in not instantiated.
     4 --- Neither String nor List are ground.
     5 --- String is neither a string nor a variable.
     5 --- List is neither a list nor a variable.
     5 --- Format in not an atom.
     6 --- Format in not a valid format specification.
     6 --- One (or more) elements of List are not integers in a valid range for Format.

Examples
   
    [eclipse 1]: string_list(S,[65,66,67],bytes).
    S = "ABC"
    yes.

    [eclipse 2]: string_list(S, [65,66,67], utf8).
    S = "ABC"
    yes.

    [eclipse 3]: string_list(S, [65, 0, 700, 2147483647], bytes).
    out of range in string_list(S, [65, 0, 700, 2147483647])

    [eclipse 4]: string_list(S, [65, 0, 700, 2147483647], utf8).
    S = "A\000\312\274\375\277\277\277\277\277"
    yes.
