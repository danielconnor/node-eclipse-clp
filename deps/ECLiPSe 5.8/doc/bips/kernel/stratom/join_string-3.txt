join_string(+List, +Glue, ?String)

   String is the string formed by concatenating the elements of List with
an instance of Glue beween each of them.



Arguments
   +List               List of atomic terms.
   +Glue               A string or atom.
   ?String             A string or variable.

Type
   Strings and Atoms

Description
   String is the string formed by concatenating the elements of List
   with an instance of Glue beween each of them.  List may contain
   numbers, atoms and strings.  The result of the concatenation is
   always a string.


   Note that concat_string/2 can be defined as



       concat_string(List, String) :-
	    join_string(List, "", String).



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- List is not instantiated (non-coroutine mode only).
     4 --- List contains free variables (non-coroutine mode only).
     5 --- List is instantiated, but not to a list of atomic terms.
     5 --- String is neither an string nor a variable.
     5 --- Glue is neither an string nor an atom.

Examples
   
Success:
    join_string([usr,"local",bin], "/", "usr/local/bin").
    join_string([1,2,3], " -> ", "1 -> 2 -> 3").

Error:
    join_string(A,"-",X).        (Error 4).
    join_string([abc,D],",",X).  (Error 4).
    join_string(art,",",X).      (Error 5).
    join_string([a,b],3,X).      (Error 5).
