substring(+String1, +String2, ?Position)

   Succeeds if String2 is a substring of String1 beginning at position
Position.



Arguments
   +String1            String.
   +String2            String.
   ?Position           Integer or variable.

Type
   Strings and Atoms

Description
   Used to test that String2 is a substring of String1 beginning at
   position Position.  In this case, String1 and String2 are strings and
   Position is an integer.


   Also used to find the first position in String1 that its substring
   String2 begins.  In this case, String1 and String2 are strings and
   Position is a variable.


   String positions must be positive and start at 1.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if String2 is not a substring of String1 beginning at position
   Position.



Exceptions
     4 --- Either String1 or String2 (or both) are not instantiated.
     5 --- Either String1 or String2 (or both) are instantiated, but    not to strings.
     5 --- Position is neither an integer nor a variable.
     6 --- Position is not a positive integer.

Examples
   
Success:
      substring("str","st",1).
      substring("abcabcabc","bc",X)     (gives X=2).
      substring("abcabcabc","bc",8).
      substring("abc","",X).            (gives X=1).
      substring("abc","",2).
Fail:
      substring("astring","strg",2).
      substring("","a",X).
Error:
      substring(S,"str",1).             (Error 4).
      substring('str',S,1).             (Error 5).
      substring("st","s",1.0).          (Error 5).
      substring("ab","a",-2).           (Error 6).
