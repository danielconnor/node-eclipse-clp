number_string(?Number, ?String)

   Conversion between any number and a string.

Arguments
   ?Number             Number or variable.
   ?String             String or variable.

Type
   Strings and Atoms

Description
   If String is instantiated, its contents is interpreted as a number which
   is in turn unified with Number.


   If Number is instantiated and String is a variable, String is bound to
   the textual representation of the number as writeq/1 would produce it.


   If String does not represent a number, then number_string/2 fails.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if String does not represent a number or the represented number
   does not unify with Number.



Exceptions
     5 --- Number is instantiated, but not to an number.
     5 --- String is instantiated, but not to a string.
     4 --- Both arguments are free variables (non-coroutine mode only).

Examples
   
   Success:
   number_string(1989,X).       (gives X = "1989").
   number_string(-7,X).         (gives X = "-7").
   number_string(124.5,X).      (gives X = "124.5").
   number_string(X,"+12").      (gives X = 12).
   number_string(X,"-7").       (gives X = -7).
   number_string(N,"123.4").     (gives N = 123.4).
   number_string(3.0,"3.0").
   number_string(3.0,"+3.00").
   Fail:
   number_string(N,"- 15").
   number_string(N," +15").
   number_string(N,"2 ").
   number_string(N,".5").
   number_string(N,"Abcd").
   number_string(222,"123").
   Error:
   number_string(N,S).          (Error 4).
   number_string(a,"12").       (Error 5).
   number_string(N,1234).       (Error 5).
