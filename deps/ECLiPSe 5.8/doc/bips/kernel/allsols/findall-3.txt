findall(?Term, +Goal, ?List)

   List is the (possibly empty) list of all instances of Term such that Goal
is provable.



Arguments
   ?Term               Prolog term, usually a variable, a compound term or list                containing variables.
   +Goal               Callable term.
   ?List               List or variable.

Type
   All Solutions

Description
   Unifies List with the list (not ordered, duplicates retained, no choice
   point) of all instances of Term such that Goal is satisfied.  The
   variables appearing in Term should not appear anywhere else in the
   clause except within Goal.


   The following table illustrates the difference between the all solutions
   predicates:



    built-in  choice pts  duplicates  sorted pruned *
    bagof/3   yes         yes         no     no
    coverof/3 yes         no          no     yes
    findall/3 no          yes         no     no
    setof/3   yes         no          yes    no
   * prune_instances/2 used on list of solutions.

   If Goal is not a callable term, exceptions are raised in call/2.


Note


 1. Even if there are uninstantiated variables in Goal which do not appear
    in Term, then unlike bagof/3, findall/3 has no choice points i.e.
    these variables are taken to be existentially quantified.


 2. findall/3 never fails; if no solution exists, the empty list is
    returned.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if List does not unify with the list of all instances of Term such
   that Goal is provable.



Exceptions
     4 --- Goal is not instantiated.
     5 --- Goal is instantiated, but not to a compound term.
    68 --- Goal is an undefined procedure.

Examples
   
Success:


   % all variables are taken to be existentially quantified:
  [eclipse]: findall(Name,current_stream(Name,Mode,Num),L),
  > writeq((Name,Mode,Num,L)), nl, fail.
  _g72 , _g78 , _g84 , [user, user, error, debug_input, null, ""]
  no (more) solution.

  [eclipse]: [user].

   h(f(1,2)).
   h(f(1,X)).
   h(f(X,Y)).   % instances of this element...

  yes.
  [eclipse]: findall(X,h(X),L).
  X = _g58
  L = [f(1, 2), f(1,2), f(1, _g116), f(_g100, _g102)]
  yes.  % ...all bagged; includes duplicates.

  [eclipse]: findall(X,current_built_in(X),L).
  X = _g58
  L = [findall/3, !/0, delayed_goals/1, delayed_goals/2,

  (',')/2, (',')/4, close_window/0, (=)/2, op/3, (>)/2,
  array/3, (spied)/1, ... / ..., ...]
  yes.

  [eclipse]: findall(X,append_strings(X,Y,"abc"),L).
  X = _g58
  Y = _g66
  L = ["", "a", "ab", "abc"]

Fail:

Error:

  findall(X,"G",L).       (Error 5).
