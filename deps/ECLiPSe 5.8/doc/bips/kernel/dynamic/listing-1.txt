listing +SpecList

   Outputs the definition of all dynamic predicates indicated by SpecList.



Arguments
   +SpecList           Sequence of expressions of the form Atom/Integer or just                Atom.

Type
   Dynamic Predicates

Description
   Outputs the definition of all dynamic predicates defined by SpecList to
   the standard output.  An expression in SpecList may be a single
   predicate in the form name/arity in which case only the clauses for
   name/arity are printed.  Alternatively the format name is accepted in
   which case all the predicates of any arity associated with name are
   output.


   The individual clauses are output in indented format using
   writeclause/2.


   No static predicates are output.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- An expression in SpecList is not instantiated.
     5 --- An expression in SpecList is not of the form Atom/Integer or    Atom.
    63 --- An expression in SpecList is not a dynamic procedure.
