dynamic +SpecList

   Declares the procedures specified by SpecList as dynamic.



Arguments
   +SpecList           Sequence of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Dynamic Predicates

Description
   Declare the procedures specified by SpecList as dynamic procedures.
   This has to be done before the procedure is defined.


   To change a static procedure to a dynamic one it must first be
   abolished.


   If the procedure was already dynamic Error 64 is raised.  The default
   error handler erases all existing clauses and succeeds.  This is useful
   for recompiling files with dynamic declarations, but it can be redefined
   if desired.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- SpecList is not instantiated.
     5 --- SpecList is instantiated, but not to a sequence of    expressions of the form Atom/Integer.
    64 --- SpecList is already dynamic.
    65 --- SpecList is already defined.

Examples
   
Success:
     [eclipse]: pred(a/1).
     no.
     [eclipse]: dynamic a/1.
     yes.
     [eclipse]: pred(a/1).
     in eclipse: dynamic prolog local debugged stopped traceable
     yes.
     [eclipse]: a(X).
     no (more) solution.
Error:
     dynamic X.                 (Error 4).
     dynamic a.                 (Error 5).
     dynamic a/1, a/1.          (Error 64). % succeeds
     get_flag(p/0,type,user),
     dynamic p/0.               (Error 65).
