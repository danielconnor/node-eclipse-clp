current_atom(?Atom)

   Succeeds if Atom is an atom in the system.



Arguments
   ?Atom               Atom or variable.

Type
   Type Testing

Description
   Used to return all currently defined atoms.


   Note that once an atom name is specified for the first time it is
   automatically made known to the system, so calls to current_atom/1 with
   any atom as an argument will always succeed.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- Atom is not instantiated to an atom.

Examples
   
Success:
   current_atom(eclipse).
   current_atom(anything).
   current_atom('My atom').

   [eclipse]: current_atom(X).

   X = []    More? (;)         % RETURN pressed
   yes.
   [eclipse]:

Error:
   current_atom(1).           Error 5.
   current_atom(man(1)).      Error 5.
