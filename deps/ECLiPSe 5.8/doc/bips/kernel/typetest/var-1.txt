Description
   Used to test whether Var is a variable or an attributed variable.  The
   difference between var/1 and free/1 is that var/1 succeeds on attributed
   variables as well.


   var/1 could be defined as



    var(X) :- free(X).
    var(X) :- meta(X).



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Var is instantiated.



Examples
   
Success:
      var(X).
      var(_abc).
      var(_).
      var(X{a}).
      suspend:(X>0), var(X).

Fail:
      var(atom).
      var('Abc').
