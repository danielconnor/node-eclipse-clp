Type
   Type Testing

Description
   Used to test whether PredSpec is a functor known to the system or to
   return all functors defined.


   Note that PredSpec is specified in the format Name/Arity and may be
   specified with Name as an atom or variable and/or Arity as an integer or
   variable.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if PredSpec is not a currently known functor.

     5 --- PredSpec is instantiated but not in the format Atom /    Integer

Examples
   
Success:
   current_functor(findall/N).
   current_functor(N/4).
   current_functor((',')/2).

   X = findall / 3     More? (;)

   X = at_eof_handler / 0     More? (;)    % RETURN pressed
   yes.
