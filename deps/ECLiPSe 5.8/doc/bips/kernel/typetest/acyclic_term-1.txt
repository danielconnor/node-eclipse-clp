acyclic_term(?Term)

   Succeeds if Term is acyclic (finite)

Arguments
   Term                Arbitrary term

Type
   Type Testing

Description
	Used to test whether Term is acyclic (a finite tree).
	Fails if Term is cyclic (an infinite, rational tree).


Fail Conditions
   Fails if Term is cyclic

Examples
   
    ?- X = f(f(a)), acyclic_term(X).
    X = f(f(a))
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- X = f(X), acyclic_term(X).
    No (0.00s cpu)


    % could be used to simulate occurs check
    unify_with_occurs_check(X, X) :- acyclic_term(X).
