current_op(?Precedence, ?Associativity, ?Name)

   Succeeds if Name is a visible operator with precedence Precedence and
associativity Associativity.



Arguments
   ?Precedence         Integer or variable.
   ?Associativity      Atom or variable.
   ?Name               Atom or variable.

Description
   Used to check for the existence of a visible operator of precedence
   Precedence with name Name and associativity Associativity.  Alternative
   solutions are returned on backtracking.


   Precedence is an integer in the range 1 to 1200.


   Associativity is one of the atoms



   xfx, xfy, yfx, fx, fy, xf, yf, fxx, fxy.



Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Name does not unify with an existing operator whose precedence
   unifies with Precedence and associativity with Associativity.



Exceptions
     5 --- Precedence is not an integer.
     5 --- Associativity is not one of the above atoms.
     5 --- Name is instantiated but not to an atom.
     6 --- Precedence is not in the range 0 to 1200.

Examples
   
Success:
   current_op(300, fx, *).

   [eclipse]: current_op(P, A, +).
   P = 500
   A = fx     More? (;)
   P = 500
   A = yfx     More? (;)   % RETURN pressed
   yes.

Fail:
   current_op(10, fx, noop).

Error:
   current_op(prec, fx, +).             (Error 5).
   current_op(100, fff, +).             (Error 5).
   current_op(100, fx, bad(op)).        (Error 5).
   current_op(-1, fx, +).               (Error 6).
