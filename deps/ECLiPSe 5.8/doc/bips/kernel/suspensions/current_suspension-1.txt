current_suspension(-Susp)

   Susp is a live (sleeping or scheduled) suspension.



Arguments
   -Susp               A variable.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for
   execution, and finally executed.


   current_suspension/1 nondeterministically enumerates all current
   suspensions. They may be either sleeping or already scheduled
   for execution. It does not return any dead suspensions.


   Note: Please do not use this predicate if you need all suspensions.
   Use suspensions/1 instead.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
[eclipse 6]: suspend(writeln(a), 3, X->inst),
        suspend(writeln(b), 5, Y->inst),
        current_suspension(S),
	get_suspension_data(S, goal, G).

X = X
Y = Y
S = 'SUSP-_393-susp'
G = writeln(b)
