make_suspension(+Goal, +Prio, -Susp)

   Make Goal a suspended goal with waking priority Prio and return the
corresponding suspension object in Susp.



Arguments
   +Goal               A Prolog Goal.
   +Prio               A small integer.
   -Susp               A variable.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   The goal Goal is made a suspended goal, i.e. it enters the suspended
   part of the resolvent and shows up as a delayed goal.  When the debugger
   is on, a DELAY port is generated.

   A suspension can be in three states:

	State		Printed as
	---------------------------------
	sleeping	'SUSP-_123-susp'
	scheduled	'SUSP-_123-sched'
	dead		'SUSP-_123-dead'


   The Prio argument determines the priority with which the Goal will be
   scheduled when woken. It can be a positive number between 1 and 12,
   or zero, in which case the priority defaults to the priority setting
   of the predicate which is called in Goal.

   Note that a suspension is not a standard Prolog data structure and can
   only be manipulated in a restricted way.  In particular, a suspension is
   not an atom although it gets printed by default in the form
   'SUSP-_123-susp'.   The only way to create a suspension is with
   make_suspension/3,4, suspend/3,4 or by copying an existing suspension.
   The contents of a suspension can only be retrieved using get_suspension_data/3.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Goal is not instantiated.
     5 --- Goal is not a callable term.
     5 --- Susp is not a variable.
     5 --- Prio is not an integer.
     6 --- Prio is not a valid priority.
    60 --- Goal refers to an undefined precedure.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: make_suspension(writeln(hello), 1, S), suspensions(Ss).

S = 'SUSP-_264-susp'
Ss = ['SUSP-_264-susp']

Delayed goals:
	writeln(hello)
Yes (0.00s cpu)


[eclipse 2]: make_suspension(true, 3, S), is_suspension(S), type_of(S,T).

S = 'SUSP-_272-susp'
T = goal


Delayed goals:
        true
Yes (0.00s cpu)
