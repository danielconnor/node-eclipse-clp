<H2>Description</H2>
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for execution,
   and finally executed.

<P>
   The task of trigger/1 is to take suspensions from the global suspension
   list associated to the symbolic name Trigger and wake them.  The
   suspensions are inserted into a global priority list, according to
   their individual priority, and then executed. Trigger/1 includes a
   call to wake/0 and is actually defined as
   <PRE>
       trigger(Trigger) :-
	   schedule_suspensions(Trigger),
	   wake.
   </PRE>
<P>
   If no suspensions are associated to Trigger, trigger/1
   just succeeds and does nothing.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
[eclipse 1]: suspend(writeln(world), 2, trigger(hello)), trigger(hello).
world
yes.
