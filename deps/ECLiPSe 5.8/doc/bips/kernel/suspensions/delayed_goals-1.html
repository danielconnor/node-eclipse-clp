<H1>delayed_goals(?GoalList)</H1>
Succeeds if GoalList is the list of all goals currently delayed.


<DL>
<DT><EM>?GoalList</EM></DT>
<DD>List, nil or variable.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Unifies GoalList with the list of all goals currently delayed.  If there
   are no goals delayed, GoalList is unified with nil.  The order of goals
   in the list is implementation-dependent.  Note that if GoalList is nil,
   the system only checks if there are any delayed goals and it does not
   actually construct the list.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if GoalList does not unify with the list of currently delayed
   goals.  It also fails when GoalList contains the right elements but in
   different order.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>GoalList is instantiated but not to a list or nil.

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
    [eclipse]: X &gt; 0, delayed_goals(L).

    X = _d89
    L = [_d89 &gt; 0]

    Delayed goals:
        _d89 &gt; 0
    yes.
    [eclipse]: X &gt; 0, delayed_goals([1 &gt; 0]).

    X = 1
    yes.

Fail:
    X &gt; 0, delayed_goals([]).

Error:
    delayed_goals(X &gt; 0).        (Error 5).
    delayed_goals(0).            (Error 5).
