delayed_goals(?Var, ?GoalList)

   Succeeds if GoalList is the list of all goals delayed by the variable Var.



Arguments
   ?Var                Any term.
   ?GoalList           List or variable.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Unifies GoalList with the list of all goals delayed by the variable Var.
   This list contains all goals that will be woken if the variable Var will
   be instantiated.  If there are no such goals, e.g.  when Var is not a
   variable, GoalList is unified with nil.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if GoalList does not unify with the list of goals delayed by the
   variable Var.  It also fails when GoalList contains the right elements
   but in different order.



Examples
   
Success:
    [eclipse]: X > 0, X < 5, delayed_goals(X, L).

    X = _d103
    L = [_d103 > 0, _d103 < 5]

    Delayed goals:
        _d103 > 0
        _d103 < 5
    yes.
    [eclipse]: X > 0, X = 1, delayed_goals(X, L).

    X = 1
    L = []
    yes.
Fail:
    X > 0, delayed_goals(X, []).
