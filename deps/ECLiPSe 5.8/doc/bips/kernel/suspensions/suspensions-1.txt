Description
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for execution,
   and finally executed.


   suspension/1 returns a list of all currently live suspensions.
   They may be either sleeping or already scheduled for execution.
   It does not return any dead suspensions.


   Note: If you are looking for one particular suspension, consider
   using current_suspension/1 instead.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions

                 suspensions(S).
