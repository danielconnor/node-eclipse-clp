<H1>kill_suspension(+Susp)</H1>
Kill the suspended goal represented by Susp, i.e. treat it as if it had
been woken.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Susp</EM></DT>
<DD>A suspension or variable.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   The suspended goal represented by Susp is killed, and the suspension is
   marked as now representing a woken goal.  If the suspension was already
   marked as woken, kill_suspension/1 just succeeds. If called with a
   variable, it succeeds as well which is useful when writing demon
   predicates that might not have a suspension the first time they are
   invoked.

<P>
   Note that a suspension is not a standard Prolog data structure and can
   only be manipulated in a restricted way.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Susp is not a suspension.
