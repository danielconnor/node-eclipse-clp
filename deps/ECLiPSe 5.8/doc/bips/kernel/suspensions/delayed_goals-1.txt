delayed_goals(?GoalList)

   Succeeds if GoalList is the list of all goals currently delayed.



Arguments
   ?GoalList           List, nil or variable.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Unifies GoalList with the list of all goals currently delayed.  If there
   are no goals delayed, GoalList is unified with nil.  The order of goals
   in the list is implementation-dependent.  Note that if GoalList is nil,
   the system only checks if there are any delayed goals and it does not
   actually construct the list.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if GoalList does not unify with the list of currently delayed
   goals.  It also fails when GoalList contains the right elements but in
   different order.



Exceptions
     5 --- GoalList is instantiated but not to a list or nil.

Examples
   
Success:
    [eclipse]: X > 0, delayed_goals(L).

    X = _d89
    L = [_d89 > 0]

    Delayed goals:
        _d89 > 0
    yes.
    [eclipse]: X > 0, delayed_goals([1 > 0]).

    X = 1
    yes.

Fail:
    X > 0, delayed_goals([]).

Error:
    delayed_goals(X > 0).        (Error 5).
    delayed_goals(0).            (Error 5).
