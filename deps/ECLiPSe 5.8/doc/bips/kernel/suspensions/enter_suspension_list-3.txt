enter_suspension_list(++Position, +Attribute, +Susp)

   Enter the suspension Susp into the suspension list at position Positiion within the structure Attribute.

Arguments
   Position            Integer indicating the position of the suspension list.
   Attribute           Compound term, typically a variable's attribute.
   Susp                A suspension

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description

   This predicate is used to add a suspension to a single suspension list.
   The suspension list is expected in the Position'th argument of the
   structure Attribute. This argument can be either an existing suspension
   list, or a variable. If it is a variable, a new suspension list with
   Susp will be created. 

   The functionality is similar to insert_suspension/3, but while
   enter_suspension_list/3 enters only into a single suspension list,
   insert_suspension/3 finds all variables in a term and inserts a
   suspension into the attribute structures of all those variables.

   Suspension lists should be regarded an opaque data structure and
   only be accessed and manipulated by the set of primitives provided
   for this purpose.



Exceptions
     4 --- Attribute, Susp or Position not instantiated.
     5 --- Attribute is not a structure, or Susp not a suspension or Position is a non-integer number.
     6 --- Attribute's arity is less than Position, or Position is zero or less.
    24 --- Position is a non-number.
   271 --- The suspension list in Position of Attribute is neither a list nor a free variable, or it contains an element which is not a suspension.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: Att = att(_, hello), init_suspension_list(1, Att),
         make_suspension(true, 3, S), enter_suspension_list(1, Att, S).

Att = att(['SUSP-_286-susp'], hello)
S = 'SUSP-_286-susp'
