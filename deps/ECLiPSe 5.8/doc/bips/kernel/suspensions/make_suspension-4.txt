make_suspension(+Goal, +Prio, -Susp, +Module)

   Make Goal from module Module a suspended goal with waking priority Prio and
return the corresponding suspension object in Susp.



Arguments
   +Goal               A Prolog Goal.
   +Prio               A small integer.
   -Susp               A variable.
   +Module             An atom.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   The goal Goal from module Module is made a suspended goal, i.e. it
   enters the suspended part of the resolvent and shows up as a delayed
   goal.  When the debugger is on, a DELAY port is generated.

   A suspension can be in three states:

	State		Printed as
	---------------------------------
	sleeping	'SUSP-_123-susp'
	scheduled	'SUSP-_123-sched'
	dead		'SUSP-_123-dead'


   The Prio argument determines the priority with which the Goal will be
   scheduled when woken. It can be a positive number between 1 and 12,
   or zero, in which case the priority defaults to the priority setting
   of the predicate which is called in Goal.

   Note that a suspension is not a standard Prolog data structure and can
   only be manipulated in a restricted way.  In particular, a suspension is
   not an atom although it gets printed by default in the form
   'SUSP-_123-susp'.   The only way to create a suspension is with
   make_suspension/3,4, suspend/3,4 or by copying an existing suspension.
   The contents of a suspension can only be retrieved using get_suspension_data/3.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.
