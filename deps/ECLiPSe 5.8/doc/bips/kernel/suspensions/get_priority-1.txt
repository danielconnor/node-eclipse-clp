get_priority(-Priority)

   Get the priority of the currently executing goal.



Arguments
   -Priority           A variable.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   All goals in ECLiPSe execute under a certain priority. An execution
   can only be interrupted by the waking of a goal with a higher
   priority. Priorities are most relevant in data-driven algorithms,
   to specify that certain goals must do their work before others
   can meaningfully execute.


   Priorities range from 1 (most urgent) to 12 (least urgent). The
   toplevel goal of an execution always runs at the lowest priority (12).


   Warning: Although it is possible to write programs that only work
   correctly under a particular priority ordering, such practice is
   strongly discouraged. Priorities should only affect efficiency,
   never correctness.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
    24 --- Priority is neither variable nor number.

Examples
   
    [eclipse 1]: get_priority(P).
    P = 12
    yes.

    [eclipse 2]: [user].
     p :- get_priority(P), writeln(prio=P).

    user       compiled traceable 120 bytes in 0.00 seconds
    yes.
    [eclipse 3]: suspend(p, 5, X->inst), X=1.
    prio = 5
    X = 1
    yes.
