subcall(+Goal, ?Delayed_goals)

   Succeeds iff Goal succeeds and unifies Delayed_goals with a list of
remaining delayed goals.



Arguments
   +Goal               Atom or compound term.
   ?Delayed_goals      Variable or list.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Calls the goal Goal.  When Goal succeeds, Delayed_goals is unified with
   a list of goals that were delayed, but not resumed during execution of
   Goal.  These goals, together with the variable bindings in Goal, can be
   regarded as a qualified answer to Goal.  I.e. Goal is true under the
   condition that the conjunction of delayed goals is also true.


   Note that, after exiting from subcall/2, the goals collected in
   Delayed_goals do no longer exist as delayed goals.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Goal fails, or if Delayed_goals does not unify with the
   returned list of goals.



Exceptions
     4 --- Goal is not instantiated.
     5 --- Goal is neither an atom nor a compound term.
    68 --- Goal is an undefined procedure.

Examples
   
Success:
    [eclipse]: X > 0, subcall(X < 5, DG).

    X = X
    DG = [X < 5]

    Delayed goals:
    X > 0
    yes.
    [eclipse]: subcall( (X > 0, Y > 0, X = 3) , DG).

    Y = Y
    X = 3
    DG = [Y > 0]
    yes.

Fail:
    subcall(fail, _).
Error:
    subcall(Var, D).                (Error 4).
    subcall(3, D).                  (Error 5).
    subcall(foo(a), D).             (Error 68).
