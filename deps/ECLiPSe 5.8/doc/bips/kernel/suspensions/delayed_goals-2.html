<H1>delayed_goals(?Var, ?GoalList)</H1>
Succeeds if GoalList is the list of all goals delayed by the variable Var.


<DL>
<DT><EM>?Var</EM></DT>
<DD>Any term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?GoalList</EM></DT>
<DD>List or variable.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Unifies GoalList with the list of all goals delayed by the variable Var.
   This list contains all goals that will be woken if the variable Var will
   be instantiated.  If there are no such goals, e.g.  when Var is not a
   variable, GoalList is unified with nil.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if GoalList does not unify with the list of goals delayed by the
   variable Var.  It also fails when GoalList contains the right elements
   but in different order.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
    [eclipse]: X &gt; 0, X &lt; 5, delayed_goals(X, L).

    X = _d103
    L = [_d103 &gt; 0, _d103 &lt; 5]

    Delayed goals:
        _d103 &gt; 0
        _d103 &lt; 5
    yes.
    [eclipse]: X &gt; 0, X = 1, delayed_goals(X, L).

    X = 1
    L = []
    yes.
Fail:
    X &gt; 0, delayed_goals(X, []).
