<H1>call_priority(+Goal, +Priority)</H1>
Execute Goal with priority Priority.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>Atom or compound term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>+Priority</EM></DT>
<DD>A small integer.

<H2>Description</H2>
   All goals in ECLiPSe execute under a certain priority. An execution
   can only be interrupted by the waking of a goal with a higher
   priority. Priorities are most relevant in data-driven algorithms,
   to specify that certain goals must do their work before others
   can meaningfully execute.

<P>
   Priorities range from 1 (most urgent) to 12 (least urgent). The
   toplevel goal of an execution always runs at the lowest priority (12).

<P>
   call_priority/2 runs a goal at a given priority. If this priority
   is higher than the one under which call_priority was invoked,
   the goal executes immediately, but will be less interruptable
   by woken goals. If the specified priority is lower, the execution
   of goal will be effectively deferred until there are no more urgent
   goal present.

<P>
   Warning: Although it is possible to write programs that only work
   correctly under a particular priority ordering, such practice is
   strongly discouraged. Priorities should only affect efficiency,
   never correctness.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
    [eclipse 1]: [user].       
     p :- call_priority(writeln(hello),8), writeln(world).

    user       compiled traceable 136 bytes in 0.00 seconds
    yes.
    [eclipse 10]: call_priority(p,5).
    world
    hello
    yes.
    [eclipse 11]: call_priority(p,10).
    hello
    world
    yes.
    [eclipse 12]: call_priority(p,8).
    hello
    world
    yes.
