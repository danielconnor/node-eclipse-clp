<H1>subcall(+Goal, ?Delayed_goals)</H1>
Succeeds iff Goal succeeds and unifies Delayed_goals with a list of
remaining delayed goals.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>Atom or compound term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Delayed_goals</EM></DT>
<DD>Variable or list.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Calls the goal Goal.  When Goal succeeds, Delayed_goals is unified with
   a list of goals that were delayed, but not resumed during execution of
   Goal.  These goals, together with the variable bindings in Goal, can be
   regarded as a qualified answer to Goal.  I.e. Goal is true under the
   condition that the conjunction of delayed goals is also true.

<P>
   Note that, after exiting from subcall/2, the goals collected in
   Delayed_goals do no longer exist as delayed goals.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Goal fails, or if Delayed_goals does not unify with the
   returned list of goals.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Goal is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Goal is neither an atom nor a compound term.
<DT><EM>(68) calling an undefined procedure </EM>
<DD>Goal is an undefined procedure.

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
    [eclipse]: X &gt; 0, subcall(X &lt; 5, DG).

    X = X
    DG = [X &lt; 5]

    Delayed goals:
    X &gt; 0
    yes.
    [eclipse]: subcall( (X &gt; 0, Y &gt; 0, X = 3) , DG).

    Y = Y
    X = 3
    DG = [Y &gt; 0]
    yes.

Fail:
    subcall(fail, _).
Error:
    subcall(Var, D).                (Error 4).
    subcall(3, D).                  (Error 5).
    subcall(foo(a), D).             (Error 68).
