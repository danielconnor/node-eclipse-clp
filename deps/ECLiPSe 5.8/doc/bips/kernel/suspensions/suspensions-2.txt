Description
    Retrieves all live suspensions attached to the variable Var, and
    returns them in a duplicate-free list SuspensionList.

    Note that this is a relatively expensive operation, involving collecting
    all suspensions lists from the variable's attributes via their respective
    suspensions-handlers, then removing duplicates and dead suspensions.


Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   None

[eclipse 2]: suspend:(X>5), suspensions(X, S).
