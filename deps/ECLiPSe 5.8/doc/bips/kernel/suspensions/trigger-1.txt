trigger(+Trigger)

   Wake the suspensions associated with the symbolic trigger Trigger
until there are no more left.



Arguments
   +Trigger            An atom.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for execution,
   and finally executed.


   The task of trigger/1 is to take suspensions from the global suspension
   list associated to the symbolic name Trigger and wake them.  The
   suspensions are inserted into a global priority list, according to
   their individual priority, and then executed. Trigger/1 includes a
   call to wake/0 and is actually defined as
   
       trigger(Trigger) :-
	   schedule_suspensions(Trigger),
	   wake.
   

   If no suspensions are associated to Trigger, trigger/1
   just succeeds and does nothing.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: suspend(writeln(world), 2, trigger(hello)), trigger(hello).
world
yes.
