<H2>Description</H2>
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for execution,
   and finally executed.

<P>
   The task of schedule_suspensions/1 is to take suspensions from the
   global suspension list associated to the symbolic name Trigger, and
   schedule them for execution.  The suspensions are inserted into a
   global priority list, according to their individual priority.  A
   subsequent wake/0 will then actually execute them.

<P>
   If no suspensions are associated to Trigger, schedule_suspensions/1
   just succeeds and does nothing.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
[eclipse 1]: suspend(writeln(world), 2, trigger(hello)),
        schedule_suspensions(hello), wake.  
world
yes.
