schedule_suspensions(+Trigger)

   Take the suspension list associated with the symbolic trigger
Trigger and schedule them for execution.



Arguments
   +Trigger            An atom.

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages: They are created,
   attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later scheduled for execution,
   and finally executed.


   The task of schedule_suspensions/1 is to take suspensions from the
   global suspension list associated to the symbolic name Trigger, and
   schedule them for execution.  The suspensions are inserted into a
   global priority list, according to their individual priority.  A
   subsequent wake/0 will then actually execute them.


   If no suspensions are associated to Trigger, schedule_suspensions/1
   just succeeds and does nothing.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: suspend(writeln(world), 2, trigger(hello)),
        schedule_suspensions(hello), wake.  
world
yes.
