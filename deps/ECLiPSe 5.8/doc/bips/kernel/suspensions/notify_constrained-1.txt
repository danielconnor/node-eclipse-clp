notify_constrained(?Var)

   Notify the system that the given variable was constrained

Arguments
   Var                 A variable or any term

Type
   Advanced Control and Suspensions

Description
   When an extension package recognizes that new constraints have been
   imposed on a particular attributed variable, it must notify the system
   about it, so that other packages (e.g.  Propia) or system primitives
   (e.g.  guards) can deliver proper results.
   
   The operational semantics is that the 'constrained' suspension list
   of the given variable will be scheduled for waking.  After calling
   notify_constrained/1 (and possibly after scheduling further suspension
   lists in one go) a call to wake/0 must be made in order to actually
   execute the scheduled suspensions.
   
   Although notify_constrained/1 can safely be called with a simple variable
   or nonvariable argument, doing so has no effect and will simply succeed.
