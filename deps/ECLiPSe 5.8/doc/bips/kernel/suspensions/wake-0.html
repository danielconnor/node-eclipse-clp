<H1>wake</H1>
Execute all scheduled suspensions whose priorities are higher than the current
one.

<H2>Description</H2>
   Suspensions in ECLiPSe go through several stages:  They are
   created, attached to variables or symbolic triggers, later
   scheduled for execution, and finally executed.

<P>
   When a suspension is scheduled for execution, it gets inserted
   into a global priority list where it is waiting for execution.
   This global priority list is then processed explicitly by the
   wake/0 predicate.
   
   This separation of scheduling and execution enables the proper
   handling of priorities:  Low priority suspensions are not
   necessarily executed by the next wake/0, but possibly later
   when the current priority has become low enough.

<P>
   The separation also allows to schedule a batch of suspension lists
   together before entering the priority-based execution scheme.

<P>
   wake/0 should therefore be called in the following situations:
    
   1.  after new suspensions have been scheduled by one or several
   calls to schedule_suspensions/1,2 or notify_constrained/1.

<P>
   2.  whenever the current priority was lowered, since that may allow
   further scheduled goals to be executed.

<P>
   Note that wake/0 is implicitly invoked after every sequence of
   meta_unify handlers and should thus not be called inside the handlers.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.
