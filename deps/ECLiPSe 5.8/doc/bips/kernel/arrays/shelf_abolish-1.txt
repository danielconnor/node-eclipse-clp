shelf_abolish(+ShelfHandle)

   Destroy a shelf explicitly

Arguments
   ShelfHandle         A shelf handle

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This explicitly destroys a previously created shelf object and
	frees all its memory.  Invoking shelf_abolish/1 is optional,
	the shelf will be automatically destroyed when the system
	backtracks across the call to shelf_create/2,3, or when the
	ShelfHandle is no longer needed and gets garbage collected.

	Using the ShelfHandle after it has been destroyed will lead
	to an error message. Destroying an already destroyed shelf
	does nothing and is silently accepted.
    

Resatisfiable
   No

Fail Conditions

Exceptions
     4 --- ShelfHandle is not instantiated
     5 --- ShelfHandle is not a shelf
    40 --- ShelfHandle refers to an already destroyed shelf

Examples
   For examples see shelf_create/2,3.
