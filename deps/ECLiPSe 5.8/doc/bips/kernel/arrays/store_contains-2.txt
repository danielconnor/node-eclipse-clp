store_contains(+StoreHandle, ++Key)

   Check for an entry in a store object

Arguments
   StoreHandle         A store handle or store name
   Key                 A ground term

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This checks whether a given store object contains an entry for a
	given key.  If so, the predicate succeeds, otherwise it fails.

	The key can be arbitrarily complex, but must be a ground term.

	The complexity of this  operation is linear in the size
	of the key, since the key needs to be compared. For indexing purposes,
	a hash value is computed from the key, and the full depth of the key
	is taken into account.

	Note: If StoreHandle is not a handle, then it must be an atom or a
	compound term, and the store is identified by this term's toplevel
	functor together with the context module.

    

Resatisfiable
   No

Fail Conditions
   The store does not contain an entry for Key

Exceptions
     4 --- StoreHandle is uninstantiated
     4 --- Key is not ground
     5 --- StoreHandle is neither atom nor compound term nor store handle
    45 --- StoreHandle is not the name of a store

Examples
   

    ?- store_create(Handle),
       store_set(Handle, tom, 12345),
       store_contains(Handle, tom).

    ?- store_create(Handle),
       store_set(Handle, tom, 12345),
       store_contains(Handle, harry).
