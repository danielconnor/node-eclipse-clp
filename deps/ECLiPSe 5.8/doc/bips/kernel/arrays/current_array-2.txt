current_array(?Array, ?Options)

   Succeeds if there exists an array as denoted by Array and with type and
visibility as given in the list Options.



Arguments
   ?Array              Atom or compound term.
   ?Options            Variable or list.

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
   current_array/2 is used to retrieve information about existing
   visible arrays, non-logical variables and references.  Array is a
   term denoting the array's name and dimensions and Options is a list
   describing the array's type (prolog, float, integer or byte) and visibility.


Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if there is no (further) array whose name unifies with ArrayName,
   dimension list with ListOfBounds and type with Type.



Exceptions
     5 --- Array is neither variable, atom nor compound term.
     5 --- Options is neither a list nor a variable.

Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: local array(a(2)), array(b(2,3,4), float).

yes.
[eclipse 2]: current_array(a(Size), [Type,Vis|_]).

Size = 2
Type = prolog
Vis = local
yes.
[eclipse 3]: current_array(Array, Props).

Array = a(2)
Props = [prolog, local]     More? (;)

Array = b(2, 3, 4)
Props = [float, local]     More? (;)

no (more) solution.

Error:
      current_array("a", L).    (Error 5).
      current_array(a, 9).      (Error 5).
