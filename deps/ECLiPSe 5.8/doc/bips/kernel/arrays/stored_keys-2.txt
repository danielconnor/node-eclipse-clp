stored_keys(+StoreHandle, ?Keys)

   Retrieve all keys stored in a store object

Arguments
   StoreHandle         A store handle or store name
   Keys                A variable or list

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This retrieves a list of all keys under which entries are stored
	in the given store object. If the store is empty, the empty list
	is returned.

	The order of the keys in the returned list is undefined.

	The complexity of this operation is linear in the size of all keys,
	since they need to be copied.

	Note: If StoreHandle is not a handle, then it must be an atom or a
	compound term, and the store is identified by this term's toplevel
	functor together with the context module.
    

Resatisfiable
   No

Fail Conditions
   None

Exceptions
     4 --- StoreHandle is uninstantiated
     5 --- StoreHandle is neither atom nor compound term nor store handle
    45 --- StoreHandle is not the name of a store

Examples
   

    ?- store_create(Handle),
       store_set(Handle, tom, 12345),
       store_set(Handle, name(dick,tracy), phone(42376,home)),
       store_set(Handle, numbers:prime, [2,3,5,7|_More]),
       stored_keys(Handle, Keys).

    Handle = 'STORE'(16'003130e8)
    Keys = [numbers:prime, tom, name(dick, tracy)]
