bag_dissolve(+BagHandle, ?List)

   Retrieve a bag's contents and destroy the bag

Arguments
   BagHandle           A bag
   List                A variable or list of terms

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This returns a list containing a copy of every term that has
	been entered into the bag since it was created.  The bag is
	also destoyed.  It should not be assumed that the list order
	reflects the order in which the terms were entered into the
	bag.  Entering and retrieving terms from a bag involves
	copying the term each time, similar to what happens in
	setval/getval and record/recorded.  In particular, if the term
	contains variables, they lose their identity and are replaced
	with fresh ones.

	bag_dissolve/2 is equivalent to bag_retrieve/2, followed by
	bag_abolish/1.  Using the BagHandle after it has been dissolved
	will lead to an error message.
