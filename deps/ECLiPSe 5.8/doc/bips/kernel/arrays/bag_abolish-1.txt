bag_abolish(+BagHandle)

   Destroy a bag explicitly

Arguments
   BagHandle           A bag handle

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This explicitly destroys a previously created bag object and
	frees all its memory.  Invoking bag_abolish/1 is optional,
	the bag will be automatically destroyed when the system
	backtracks across the call to bag_create/1, or when the
	BagHandle is no longer needed and gets garbage collected.
	bag_dissolve/2 will also destroy the bag.

	Using the BagHandle after it has been destroyed will lead
	to an error message. Destroying an already destroyed bag
	does nothing and is silently accepted.

Fail Conditions
   None

Exceptions
     4 --- BagHandle is not instantiated
     5 --- BagHandle is not a bag
    40 --- BagHandle refers to an already destroyed bag
