local variable(+Name)

   Creates the untyped non-logical variable Name.

Arguments
   +Name               An atom.

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
   If Name is an Atom, a non-logical variable (visible only in the
   caller module) is created.  Its value is initialised to a free
   variable.  The contents of the variable persists across failures.
   The value of a non-logical variable can be changed with
   setval/2 and retrieved with getval/2.  Setting and retrieving terms
   from a non-logical variable involves copying the term each time. 
   In particular, if the term contains variables, they lose their
   identity and are replaced with fresh ones.

   Notes:

   Declaring a variable twice is silently accepted.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Name is not instantiated.
     5 --- Name is not an atom.

Examples
   
Success:
      :- local variable(a).
      :- local variable(count), variable(value).

Error:
      :- local variable(X).                        (Error 4).
      :- local variable(6).                        (Error 5).
