current_store(?StoreHandle)

   StoreName is a visible store name

Arguments
   StoreHandle         A variable or a store name (atom or compound)

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	Used to check whether StoreName is the name of a visible store,
	or to enumerate all visible store names in the context module. 

	Note that this predicate will only accept/generate store names
	that have been created with local/1, store/1, not anonymous
	store handles created via store_create/1.

	Note: StoreHandle gets unified with an atom or a compound term,
	and the store is identified by this term's toplevel functor
	together with the context module.
    

Resatisfiable
   Yes

Fail Conditions
   StoreName is not a visible store name

Exceptions
     5 --- StoreHandle is neither atom nor compound term nor variable

Examples
   
    :- local store(shed).
    :- local store(warehouse/3).

    ?- current_store(shed).
    Yes (0.00s cpu)

    ?- current_store(heap).
    No (0.00s cpu)

    ?- current_store(X).
    X = shed
    More (0.00s cpu) ? ;

    X = warehouse(_184, _185, _186)
    More (0.00s cpu) ? ;

    No (0.00s cpu)
