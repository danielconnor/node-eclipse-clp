shelf_get(+ShelfHandle, +Index, -Term)

   Retrieve a stored term from a shelf object

Arguments
   ShelfHandle         A shelf handle or shelf name
   Index               An integer
   Term                An arbitrary term or a variable

Type
   Non-logical Variables, Arrays, Bags, Shelves and Stores

Description
	This retrieves a copy of the stored term from the Index'th slot
	of the shelf object denoted by ShelfHandle.

	The slots are numbered from 1 to the maximum which was determined
	during shelf creation (but note that ECLiPSe's struct-syntax can
	be used to give the slots symbolic names, see struct/1).

	Calling shelf_get/3 with an Index of 0 retrieves the whole
	shelf with all its slots as a single compound term whose functor
	corresponds to the one that was given during shelf creation.

	Storing and retrieving terms from a shelf involves copying the
	term each time, similar to what happens in setval/getval and
	record/recorded.  In particular, if the term contains variables,
	they lose their identity and are replaced with fresh ones.

	Note: If ShelfHandle is not a handle, then it must be an atom or a
	compound term, and the shelf is identified by this term's toplevel
	functor together with the context module.
