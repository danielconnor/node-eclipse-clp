trace

   Execute subsequent top-level queries with the debugger on.



Arguments

Type
   Debugging

Description
   If the debugger is already on, no effect.  If not, the debugger
   will be switched on at the next top-level query.  The debugger will
   stay on until it is switched off with notrace/0.


   The debugger will stop at the first traceable port.


   This is not actually a predicate but a toplevel-command.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
[eclipse 1]: [user].
p :- true, writeln(hello).
user       compiled traceable 68 bytes in 0.00 seconds

yes.
[eclipse 2]: trace.
Debugger switched on - creep mode
[eclipse 3]: p.
  (1) 1 CALL  p   %> creep
S (2) 2 CALL  writeln(hello)   %> creep
hello
S (2) 2 EXIT  writeln(hello)   %> creep
  (1) 1 EXIT  p   %> creep
