make_display_matrix(+Terms, +Prio, +Type, +CondList, +Name)

      Creates a display matrix of terms that can be monitored with the 
   graphical ECLiPSe (the predicate will succeed silently in tty ECLiPSe).



Arguments
   Terms               One or two dimensional array, or list or list/integer.
   Prio                An integer.
   Type                An atom.
   CondList            An atom.
   Name                An atomic term.

   Debugging

Description
   Set up a one or two dimensional matrix of terms that can then be
   monitored for changes in their values. The terms are either provided in
   the form of an array (the nested structure type, compatible with dim/2),
   or in the form +List/+Spec, where List is a list of the terms, and Spec
   is an integer specifying the number of cells per row of the matrix, 0
   means that the matrix is to have only one row (except if the members of
   the list are matricies of the same size, in which case a two dimensional
   matrix will be created).  If List is supplied without a Spec, this is
   treated as Spec = 0.  Name specifies the name that is associated with
   this display matrix, and cannot be used for another display matrix that
   is active at the same time in the same module. The name is mapped into a
   string internally, so a name that is a atom or number is the same name
   as its equivalent string (i.e. 'matrix' and "matrix" are the same name).



   The terms are monitored by placing a demon suspension on the variables
   in each term. When a demon wakes, the new value of the term it is
   associated with is sent to the display matrix (and possibly updated,
   depending on the interactive settings on the matrix). When the new 
   value is backtracked, the old value is sent to the display matrix.
   The other arguments in this predicate is used to control when the
   demon wakes, and what sort of information is monitored. Prio is the
   priority that the demon should be suspended at, Type is designed to
   specify the attributes that is being monitored (currently all 
   attributes are monitored, and Type is a dummy argument), CondList is 
   the suspension list that the demon should be added to. Depending on
   these arguments, the level of monitoring can be controlled. Note that
   it is possible for the display matrix to show values that are out of
   date because the change was not monitored. 


   The display matrix will be removed on backtracking. However, it will 
   not be removed if make_display_matrix has been cut. It is possible to
   explicitly remove a matrix with kill_display_matrix/1.


   Each cell of the display matrix represents one term. The value of the
   term is displayed in the cell, and break-points can be set from a pop-up
   menu so that execution suspends when an update occurs in a cell. The
   term can also be inspected by the inspector. The actual current value of
   the term will be examined, which may be different from the value shown
   in the cell depending on how often the cell is updated. With breaks, the
   changes due to forward execution (further constraining of a variable's
   value) and backtracking are shown in different colours. Inspection is
   not allowed on a term that has just been backtracked, because the actual
   backtracking of the value have not yet occurred (the demon sends the old
   value just before the actual backtracking). It can be examined at the
   next break-point. The pop-up menu also shows the current displayed
   value, and the previous displayed value for the cell.




Resatisfiable
      No (but display matrix removed on backtracking).		

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- Type errors in the various arguments.
     6 --- Name has already been given to another display matrix that                is still active.

Examples
   
   queens(N, List) :-
       length(List, N),
       List :: 1..N,
       make_display_matrix(List/3, 1, any, constrained, queens),
       % sets up a matrix with rows of 3 elements. This is the only
       % extra goal that has to be added to enable monitoring
       alldistinct(List),
       constrain_queens(List),
       % Label the variables
       labeling(List).
