untraceable +SpecList

   Declares the procedure(s) in SpecList to be untraceable.



Arguments
   SpecList            Sequence of expressions of the form name/arity.

Type
   Debugging

Description
   Sets all the procedures given by SpecList untraceable.  Marking a
   predicate as untraceable will prevent any information about it being
   displayed.  The subgoals of this predicate will be shown in their normal
   way.


   Note that untraceable/1 is superseded by the predicate set_flag(Proc,
   leash, notrace), which declares the procedure Proc to be untraceable.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- SpecList is not instantiated.
     5 --- SpecList is not of the form Atom/Integer.
    60 --- SpecList is an undefined procedure.
