skipped +SpecList

   Declares all the procedures given in SpecList as skipped.



Arguments
   SpecList            Sequence of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Debugging

Description
   Sets all the procedures given by SpecList in skipped mode.  Marking a
   predicate as skipped will prevent any information about its subgoals
   being displayed by the debugger.


   The procedures are all of the form name/arity, or else of the form name,
   in which case all procedures with name name are skipped.


   Note that skipped/1 is superseded by the predicate call set_flag(Proc,
   skip, on), which declares the procedure Proc as skipped.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- SpecList is not instantiated.
     5 --- SpecList is instantiated, but is not of the form atom or    Atom/Integer.
    60 --- SpecList is not a defined procedure.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: [user], skipped p/0.
       q.   p :- q.
       user compiled 60 bytes in 0.02 seconds

      Debugger switched on - creep mode
      yes.
      [eclipse]: p.
      S (1) 0  CALL   p (dbg)?- creep
      S (1) 0  EXIT   p (dbg)?- creep  % information on
      yes.                             % q not printed.
