unskipped +SpecList

   Sets the procedures specified in SpecList to be unskipped or not skipped.



Arguments
   SpecList            Sequence of expressions of the form Atom/Integer.

Type
   Debugging

Description
   Undoes the effect of a call to skipped/1 on the specified procedure(s),
   i.e.  its subgoals will now be traced.


   The expressions in SpecList are all of the form name/arity.


   Note that unskipped/1 is superseded by the predicate set_flag(Proc,
   skip, off), which sets the procedure Proc to be unskipped.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- SpecList is not instantiated.
     5 --- SpecList is instantiated, but not of the form atom or    Atom/Integer.
    60 --- SpecList contains an undefined procedure.
