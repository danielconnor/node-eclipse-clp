kill_display_matrix(+Name)

      Destroys an existing display matrix. 



Arguments
   Name                An atomic term.

Type
   Debugging

Description
   Destroys an existing display matrix. The display matrix is removed
   from being displayed. This command can only kill a display matrix within
   the `logical scope' of the display matrix, i.e. within the part of the
   search-tree rooted at the node where the display matrix was created.
   The display matrix window may persist beyond the logical scope, and in
   such cases the window can only be killed on the GUI side. Normally, 
   the matrix is removed on backtracking pass its point of creation, but
   this may not occur due to cuts.


   Name is mapped into a string internally, so a name that is a atom or
   number is the same name as its equivalent string (i.e. 'matrix' and
   "matrix" are the same name).  Note that display matrix names are local
   to a module, so it should be killed in the module in which it was
   created (perhaps with @/2 wrapper around the call).




Resatisfiable
      No.	

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- Name is not an atomic term.
     6 --- Name is not an existing display matrix.

Examples
   
   kill_display_matrix(queens).
