   Reset the debugger

Type
   Debugging

Description

    Reset the debugger. In particular, this includes:
    
	reset invocation numbers so they start from 0 again
	reset all filter conditions
	raise the debug-init event (250) at the next trace/1, debug/1
	    or any predicate that has the start_tracing flag set.
    
    Note that debug_reset/0 just sets some parameters, it does not
    activate the debugger immediately. This only happens when a trace/1,
    debug/1, or predicate with the start_tracing flag is executed.
    
    The debugger cannot be reset while it is active. The predicate will
    fail in this case.


Fail Conditions
   Debugger is active and cannot be reset at this time

Examples
   
[eclipse]: trace(true), trace(true), debug_reset, trace(true). 
  (1) 1 CALL  true   %> creep
  (1) 1 EXIT  true   %> creep
  (3) 1 CALL  true   %> creep
  (3) 1 EXIT  true   %> creep
  (1) 1 CALL  true   %> creep
  (1) 1 EXIT  true   %> creep
