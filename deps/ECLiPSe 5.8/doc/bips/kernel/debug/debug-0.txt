debug

   Execute subsequent top-level queries with the debugger on.



Arguments

Type
   Debugging

Description
   If the debugger is already on, no effect.  If not, the debugger
   will be switched on at the next top-level query.  The debugger will
   stay on until it is switched off with notrace/0.


   The debugger will stop at the first traceable port.


   This is not actually a predicate but a toplevel-command.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.
