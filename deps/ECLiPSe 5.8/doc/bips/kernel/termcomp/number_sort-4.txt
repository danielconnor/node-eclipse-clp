number_sort(+Key, +Order, +Random, ?Sorted)

   Succeeds if Sorted is the numerically sorted list
	version of Random.  The sort is done according to the Key and
	Order specifications.



Arguments
   +Key                A non-negative integer or a list of positive integers.
   +Order              One of the atoms <, =<, > or >=.
   +Random             List.
   ?Sorted             List or variable.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   Sorts the list Random according to the Key and Order specifications,
   and unifies Sorted with the result.  The sort is stable, i.e. the
   order of elements with the same key is preserved.


   If Random is not a list of compound terms, use Key = 0. The list
   elements must be numerical terms.


   If Random is a list of compound terms, then the sort will be according
   to the Keyth argument of the list elements. The Keyth argument of each
   list element must be a numeric term.


   In all cases, Order specifies whether the list is sorted into ascending
   (<, =<) or descending (>, >=) order and whether duplicates are to be
   retained (=<, >=) or eliminated (<, >).  The way to remember the Order
   argument is that it is the relation which holds between adjacent
   elements in the result.


   The sort is done according to numerical ordering as opposed to
   sort/4 which uses the standard ordering of terms. See compare/3 for 
   this standard ordering. In particular for numeric terms of
   different type, e.g. integers and floats, the numerical and
   standard orderings differ: 1 < 2.0 but 2.0 @< 1. Additionally
   the ordering of bounded reals differs. While the standard ordering
   treats a bounded real as a compound term and orders them by lower
   bound and then upper bound, numerical ordering treats them as true
   intervals. As a consequence the order of overlapping intervals is
   undefined: 1.0__1.1 @< 1.0__1.2 while no numerical order is
   defined. In such cases an arithmetic exception is thrown. This can
   have unexpected consequences: care must be taken when  sorting a
   list containing both rationals and bounded reals. While integers
   and floats are converted to zero-width intervals for the purposes
   of comparison, rationals are converted to small intervals
   guaranteed to contain the rational, e.g X is breal(1_1) gives
   X=0.99999999999999989__1.0000000000000002 and thus no order is
   defined between 1_1 and 1.0__1.0.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Sorted does not unify with the sorted list version of Random.



Exceptions
     4 --- One of List1 and List2 has an element whose Keyth argument is a variable
     5 --- Key is greater than 0, and one of List1 and List2 has an element whose Keyth argument is a non-numeric term
     5 --- Key is greater than 0, and one of List1 and List2 does not    have all elements compound terms.
     5 --- Key is not an integer or a list of integers.
     6 --- One of the compound terms in List1 or List2 has not got as    many as Key arguments.
    20 --- One of List1 and List2 has elements whose numerical order is undefined.

Success:

      number_sort(0,=<,[1,1.0,1_1,3,2,3,4,1],S).
			   (gives S=[1,1.0,1_1,1,2,3,3,4]).
      number_sort(0,=<,[1,1.0,1.0__1.0,3,2,3,4,1],S).
			   (gives S=[1,1.0,1.0__1.0,1,2,3,3,4]).
      number_sort(2,<,[f(a,3),h(b,1)],S).         (gives S=[h(2,1),f(1,3)]).
