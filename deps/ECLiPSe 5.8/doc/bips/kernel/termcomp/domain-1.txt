local domain(++Def)
export domain(++Def)

   Define a domain (a set of symbols mapped to natural numbers)

Arguments
   ++Def               A structure with atomic arguments.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description

	This defines a domain. A domain definition is a ground structure
	with atomic arguments. The structure's functor name is taken as
	the name of the domain. The domain name is used e.g. for declaring
	domain variables in lib(ic_symbolic).
	
	The structure's arguments are the domain values. A domain value
	can be any atomic term (atom, string, number), but will usually
	be an atom. Domains are ordered, and the argument order in the
	defining structure implies the order of the domain values.
	The domain values are mapped to natural numbers, with the first
	argument being mapped to 1, the second to 2 and so on.
	
	After having been defined, the mapping can be looked up via the
	primitives domain_index/3 and current_domain/3. Certain libraries
	(e.g. lib(ic_symbolic)) use the defined mapping internally.
	
	Domain definitions can be local or exported. The domain values of
	all visible domain definitions within a module must be mutually
	exclusive, i.e. there must not be any ambiguity as to which domain
	a particular value belongs to. The system checks this condition
	whenever new domains are defined or imported.

Exceptions
     4 --- Def is not ground
     5 --- Def is neither variable nor structure
     5 --- A domain value is not atomic
     6 --- A domain value is not unique in this module
    87 --- The domain name is already used locally
    88 --- The domain name is already used and exported
    89 --- The domain name is already used by an imported domain
