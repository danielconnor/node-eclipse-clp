?Term1 = ?Term2

   Succeeds if Term1 and Term2 unify.



Arguments
   ?Term1              An arbitrary term.
   ?Term2              An arbitrary term.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   Succeeds if the term Term1 unifies with the term Term2,
   otherwise it fails.


   The unification procedure does not contain an occur check.  Hence,
   cyclic structures can be created during unification.  These cyclic
   structures may cause loops in attempting unification.  eg.  X = f(X,Y),
   Y = f(X,Y).




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Term1 does not unify with Term2.



Exceptions
    11 --- Term1 or Term2 contain an attributed variable and it is unified with a    nonvariable.

Examples
   
   Success:
   atom = atom.
   atom = X.          (gives X = atom)
   X = atom.          (gives X = atom)
   f(1) = X.          (gives X = f(1))
   Y = X.             (gives Y = _g68, X = _g68)
   [1,X] = [Y,2].     (gives X = 2, Y = 1)
   [1,X|Y] = [W,2|Z]. (gives X = 2, Y = _g78,
   W = 1, Z = _g78)
   [1,A,2,B] = [C|D]. (gives A = _g80, B = _g88,
   C = 1, D = [_g80, 2, _g88])
   Fail:
   atom = neutron.
   1.0 = 1.
   [a|b] = [a,b].
