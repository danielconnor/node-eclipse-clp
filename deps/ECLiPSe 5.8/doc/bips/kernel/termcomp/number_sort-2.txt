number_sort(+List1, ?List2)

   Succeeds if List2 is the numerically ordered version of List1.



Arguments
   +List1              List of numeric terms.
   ?List2              List of numeric terms or variable.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   List1 is sorted according to numerical ordering, and unified with List2.

   The sort is done according to numerical ordering and duplicates are
   retained as opposed to sort/2 which uses the standard ordering of
   terms and removes duplicates. See number_sort/4 for a discussion of
   the differences between numerical and standard ordering of numeric types.

Note
   number_sort(L1,L2) is equivalent to number_sort(0,=<,L1,L2).


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if List2 does not unify with the sorted list version of List1.



Examples
   
Success:
      sort([3,1,6,7,2],S).     (gives S=[1,2,3,6,7]).
      sort([1,3,2,3,4,1],S).   (gives S=[1,1,2,3,3,4]).
Fail:
      sort([2,1,3,4],[2,1,3,4]).
