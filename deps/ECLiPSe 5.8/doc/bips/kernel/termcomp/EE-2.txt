Description
   Used to compare Term1 with Term2.  Succeeds if Term1 and Term2 are
   identical terms.  It does not attempt unification.  Two variables are
   considered as identical only if one is bound to the other, or if they
   are both bound to identical terms.  Ground terms are identical only if
   they unify.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Term1 and Term2 are not identical.



Examples
   
   Success:
   atom == atom.
   1 == 1.
   X == X.                      (gives X = _g70)
   X = 1, Y = 1, Y == X.        (gives X = 1, Y = 1)
   X = Y, X == Y, Y == X.       (gives Y = _g80, X = _g80)
   [ a,b| [ ] ] == [ a,b ].
   f(1,2) == f(1,2).
   Fail:
   atom == neutron.
   atom == X.
   1 == 1.0.
   X == Y.
   [a|b] == [a,b].
   [a|X] == [a,X].
