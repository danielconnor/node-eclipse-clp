instance(?Instance, ?Term)

   Succeeds if Instance is an instance of Term.



Arguments
   ?Instance           An arbitrary term.
   ?Term               An arbitrary term.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   Succeeds if it is possible to find an instantiation of free variables in
   Term such that Term and Instance are equal.  The result is undefined if
   Term and Instance share variables.  Note that no unification actually
   occurs.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Instance is not an instance of Term.



Examples
   
   Success:
   instance(atom,X).
   instance(f(a,b),X).
   instance(f(a,b),f(X,Y)).
   instance(f(a,X),f(Y,X)).
   instance(f(a,X),f(X,Y)).
   instance(f(X,Y),f(Y,X)).
   instance([a,b,c],[A,B,C]).
   instance([a,f(1,b,X),Y|Z],T).
   instance(f(X),X).         % with occur_check off
   Fail:
   instance(f(a,b),f(X,X)).
   instance(X,a).
   instance(f(X),X).         % with occur_check on
