keysort(+List1, ?List2)

   Succeeds if List2 is a sorted list version of List1, whose elements are of
the form Key-Value.  The sort is done according to the value of the key
Key.



Arguments
   +List1              List of elements of the form Term-Term.
   ?List2              List or variable.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   The elements of List1 are of the form Key-Value, where Key and Value are
   both arbitrary terms.


   List1 is sorted according to the value of the key Key and the result is
   unified with List2.  No sorting is carried out on Value.  The sort is
   stable, i.e. the order of elements with the same key is preserved.


   The sort is done according to the standard ordering of terms.
   See compare/3 for this standard ordering.
   Note in particular that numbers are first ordered by their type (integer,
   float, etc) and only then by their magnitude, i.e. sorting numbers of
   different types may not give the expected result.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if List2 does not unify with the sorted list version of List1,
   which is done according to the value of the key Key.



Exceptions
     4 --- List1 is not instantiated.
     5 --- Either List1 or List2 is instantiated, but not to a list of    the form Term-Term.

Examples
   
Success:
      keysort([n-1,4-a],L).     (gives L = [4-a,n-1]]).
      keysort([f(1)-a,[1]-w,7.2-b,"k"-e,n-q],L).
             (gives L = [7.2-b,"k"-e,n-q,f(1)-a,[1]-w]).
      keysort([f(1,2),g(1)],M). (gives M = [f(1,2),g(1)]).
      keysort([g(1,2)-a, f(1,2)-a],M).
             (gives M = [f(1,2)-a,g(1,2)-a]).
      keysort([f(4,3)-a, f(3,4)-b],M).
             (gives M = [f(3,4)-b,f(4,3)-a]).

Fail:
      keysort([n-1,M-a],[n-1,M-a]).

Error:
      keysort(L1,L2).              (Error 4).
      keysort([n-1,m],L).          (Error 5).
