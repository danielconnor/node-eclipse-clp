variant(?Term1, ?Term2)

   Succeeds if Term1 is a variant of Term2.



Arguments
   ?Term1              An arbitrary term.
   ?Term2              An arbitrary term.

Type
   Comparing and Sorting

Description
   Succeeds if the given terms are equal in the sense that all
   ground instantiations in Term1 are also instantiations in Term2 and vice
   versa.  The result is undefined if Term1 and Term2 share variables.  No
   unification is performed.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Term1 is not a variant of Term2.



Examples
   
   Success:
   variant(1,1).
   variant(X,Y).
   variant(f(a,b),f(a,b)).
   variant(f(a,X),f(a,Y)).
   variant(f(X,Y),f(Y,X)).
   variant([X,2], [Y,2]).
   Fail:
   variant(f(a,b),f(a,Y)).
   variant(f(a,X),f(a,b)).
   variant(f(X,Y),f(Z,Z)).
