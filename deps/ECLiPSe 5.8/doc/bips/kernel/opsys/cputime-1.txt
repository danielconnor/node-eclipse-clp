cputime(?Time)

   Succeeds if Time is the elapsed user cpu time in seconds.



Arguments
   ?Time               Float number or variable.

Type
   Operating System

Description
   Used to find the elapsed user cpu time in seconds, it is equivalent to
   statistics(times, [Time|_]).


   The cpu time is the `user' time i.e.  the CPU time used while executing
   instructions in the user space of the calling process.


   Note that the granularity of the system clock is usually 1/60 or 1/50 of
   a second.  Hence if you use cputime/1 to measure runtimes make sure that
   the measured intervals are long enough.


   The time given by the ps command gives the sum of `user' time and
   `system' time, which is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of the
   calling process.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if Time is not the elapsed `user' cpu time.



Exceptions
     5 --- Time is instantiated, but not to a float.

Examples
   
Success:
   [eclipse]: cputime(T).
   T = 0.0333333
   yes.

Fail:
      cputime(0.000001).
Error:
      cputime(2).                    (Error 5).
