pathname(+FilePath, ?Path, ?BaseName, ?Suffix)

   Decomposes a filename into its directory path, base name and suffix

Arguments
   +FilePath           String or atom.
   ?Path               Variable or string.
   ?BaseName           Variable or string.
   ?Suffix             Variable or string.

Type
   Operating System

Description
   This predicate is used to decompose FilePath which is either a relative
   or absolute pathname of a file, into three components, namely the pathname
   of its parent directory including the trailing "/" if any, the `base'
   name of the file (the plain file name without the suffix), and the
   suffix, if any. The concatenation of Path, BaseName and Suffix yields
   the original filename FilePath.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
   None

Exceptions
     4 --- FilePath is not instantiated.
     5 --- FilePath is neither a string nor an atom.
     5 --- Path, BaseName or Suffix is neither a string nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:

     [eclipse]: pathname("/home/user/userfile.pl", P, B, S).

     P = "/home/user/"
     B = "userfile"
     S = ".pl"
     yes.

      [eclipse]: pathname("/home/user/userfile", P, B, S).
      P = "/home/user/"
      B = "userfile"
      S = ""
      yes.

Fail:
      pathname("/home/file.pl","/home/","file", "pl").

Error:
      pathname(F,P,R,S).                 (Error 4).
      pathname("/home/file.pl",P,file,'.pl')    (Error 5).
