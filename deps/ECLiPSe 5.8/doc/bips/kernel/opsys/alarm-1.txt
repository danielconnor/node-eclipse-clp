alarm(+Clock)

   The operating system will send the signal 14 to the ECLiPSe system Clock
seconds after the command was entered.



Arguments
   +Clock              Integer

Type
   Operating System

Description
   Used to send the signal 14 (SIGALRM) to the ECLiPSe system Clock seconds
   after the alarm/1 command is entered.  If there is already a pending
   alarm, its clock is merely reset, i.e.  there cannot be multiple alarm
   requests.


   If Clock is 0, any pending alarm is cancelled.  If Clock is negative, it
   is nevertheless interpreted as an unsigned integer.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Clock is not instantiated.
     5 --- Clock is not an integer.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: alarm(1).
      yes.
      [eclipse]: Signal 14         % 1 second later

Error:
      alarm(I).                    (Error 4).
      alarm(2.0).                  (Error 5).
