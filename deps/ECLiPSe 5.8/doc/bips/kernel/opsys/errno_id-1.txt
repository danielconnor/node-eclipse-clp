errno_id(-Message)

   Message is bound to the message string that corresponds to most recent
operating system error that occurred during the execution.



Arguments
   -Message            Variable.

Type
   Operating System

Description
   This predicate unifies Message with the string that corresponds to the
   most recent operating system error that occurred during the execution.
   These messages differ between different operating systems.
   Operating system interface errors which occur within built-in predicates
   are normally indicated by the predicate raising event 170
   "system interface error". The event handler then retrieves the
   error message using errno_id/1. The system remembers the last error
   message until a new error occurs.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- Message is neither variable nor string.

Examples
   
[eclipse 3]: delete(nofile).
system interface error: No such file or directory in delete(nofile)

[eclipse 4]: errno_id(Msg).
Msg = "No such file or directory"
yes.
