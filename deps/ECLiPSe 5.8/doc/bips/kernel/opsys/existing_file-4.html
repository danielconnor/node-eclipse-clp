<H2>Description</H2>

    This file will search for any existing files that matches the
    specifications given in the first three arguments: the file starts with
    Base, which is a partial filepath name. Base may have a library/1
    wrapper around the name. A list of possible completions (usually
    suffixes) given in Completions is appended to Base, in the order they
    are given, to give a complete name. If a proper file
    (i.e. non-directory) with this name exists, the ECLiPSe process's
    permission for this file are checked against the Permissions list --
    the list can contain the atoms readable, writable, executable; each
    specifying that the corresponding permission should be checked. If the
    permissions match, then the filename is returned in MatchedFile.

<P>
    If the library/1 wrapper is used, then the file is searched for in the
    paths specified in library path (including any subdirectory with the
    same name as given in the library/1 wrapper).  Otherwise, the search is
    relative to the current working directory. All matching names can be
    returned via backtracking. The search order is that if library/1
    wrapper is used, then the library path is tried in the order in which
    they appear in the library_path flag of get_flag/2, and for each path,
    the completions are tried in the order in which they appeared in
    Completions.

<P>
    MatchedFile is in the same form as Base, except that if library(...) is 
    used, the proper library path is substituted. Also, any leading '~' and
    enviroment variables (specified with a leading '$') are replaced. 

<P>
    The predicates canonical_path_name/2 and existing_file/4 are intended
    as replacement for absolute_file_name/2 in previous releases. The
    functionality of completing an incomplete name and returning an
    absolute path of absolute_file_name/2 has been separated. The following
    approximately implements the old absolute_file_name/2:

<PRE>
    absolute_file_name(Rel, Abs) :-
	(Rel == user ->
	    Abs == user
	; get_flag(prolog_suffix, Sufs),
	  (existing_file(Rel, Sufs, [], ExtRel) -> true ; ExtRel = Rel),
	  canonical_path_name(ExtRel, Abs)
        ).
</PRE>

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success: 

      [eclipse 1]:  existing_file(library(fd), [".eco"], [readable], File).

      File = "/homes/ks15/Eclipse/lib/fd.eco"     More? (;) 

      % test1 and test3 exists in current working directory
      [eclipse 1]: existing_file(test, [1,2,3], [], File).

      File = test1     More? (;) 

      File = test3     More? (;) 

      no (more) solution.

Failure:

      [eclipse 1]:  existing_file(library(fd), [], [readable], File).
      % no Completions at all; will always fail

      [eclipse 1]:  existing_file(library(fd), [""], [readable], File).
      % no library file with just 'fd' as the name (file has a suffix)
