random(?N)

   Generates a random integer N.



Arguments
   ?N                  Integer or Variable.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
random/1 unifies N with a random integer between 0 and 2^31-1
   (returned by the C library function random(), whose initialization
   has been made using the pid of the running ECLiPSe ).


   If it is required that the sequence produced by successive calls of
   random/1 be reproducible, seed(Seed) can be called to initialise the
   calls with the integer Seed.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- N is instantiated, but not to an integer.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: random(N1), random(N2).
      N1 = 464880439
      N2 = 285401533
      yes.

      [eclipse]: seed(1), random(N).
      N = 2078917053
      yes.
      [eclipse]: seed(1), random(N).
      N = 2078917053
      yes.

Fail:
      random(12345).

Error:
      random(12.34).          (Error 5).
