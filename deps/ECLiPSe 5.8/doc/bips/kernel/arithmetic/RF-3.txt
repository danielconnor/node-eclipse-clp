\/(+Number1, +Number2, ?Result)

   Evaluates the bitwise disjunction Number1 \/ Number2 and unifies the
resulting value with Result.



Arguments
   +Number1            Integer.
   +Number2            Integer.
   ?Result             A variable or integer.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to \/(Number1, Number2, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is Number1 \/ Number2

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number1 or Number2 are free variables, the call
   to \//3 is delayed until these variables are instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number1 or Number2 is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode    only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not an integer.
     5 --- Number1 or Number2 is a number but not an integer.
    24 --- Number1 or Number2 is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      \/(11, 7, 15).
      \/(11, -7, Result).     (gives Result = -5)
Fail:
      \/(1, 2, 4).
Error:
      \/(A, 2, 6).              (Error 4).
      \/(6, 2.0, 6.0).          (Error 5).
      \/(4 + 2, 2, 6).          (Error 24).
      \/(5, 2, r).              (Error 24).
