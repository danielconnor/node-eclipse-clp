round(+Number, ?Result)

   Rounds Number to the nearest integral value of the same type

Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable or number.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to round(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is round(Number)

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to round/2
   is delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Number and Result are numbers of different type.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      round(1.49, 1.0).
      round(1.5, 2.0).          (odd integer part)
      round(2.5, 2.0).
      round(2.51, 3.0).         (even integer part)
      round(3.5, 4.0).
      round(-6.4, Result).      (gives Result = -6.0)
      round(3, 3).
Fail:
      round(1, 0.0).
Error:
      round(A, 6.0).                   (Error 4).
      round(0.5, 0).                   (Error 5).
      round(4 + 2.3, 6.0).             (Error 24).
      round(1, r).                     (Error 24).
