\(+Number, ?Result)

   Evaluates the bitwise complement of Number and unifies the resulting value
with Result.



Arguments
   +Number             Integer.
   ?Result             A variable or integer.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to \(Number, Result) is equivalent
   to

    Result is \Number

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to \/2 is
   delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not an integer.
     5 --- Number is a number but not an integer.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      \(1, -2).
      \(5, Result).            (gives Result = -6)
      \(-6, Result).           (gives Result = 5)
Fail:
      \(1, 0).
Error:
      \(A, 6).                   (Error 4).
      \(0.0, 0.0).               (Error 5).
      \(4 + 2, -7).              (Error 24).
      \(1, r).                   (Error 24).
