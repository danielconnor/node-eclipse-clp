+Expr1 > +Expr2

   Succeed if the value of Expr1 is greater than the value of Expr2.



Arguments
   +Expr1              An arithmetic expression
   +Expr2              An arithmetic expression

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   Both arguments are evaluated and their types adjusted.  Then the
   resulting numbers are compared.  The predicate succeeds if the value of
   Expr1 is greater than the value of Expr2.  If the system is in
   coroutining mode and the arguments are not ground, this predicate delays
   until the expressions are fully instantiated.

   The predicate also delays when the comparison involves bounded reals,
   and the compared values overlap such that the result is undecidable.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      fails if the value of Expr1 is less or equal to the value of Expr2



Exceptions
     4 --- Expr1 or Expr2 is a variable (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Expr1 or Expr2 is not an arithmetic expression.

Examples
   
   Success:
   5 - 1 > 6 / 2.
   1 > sin(pi/4).            % 1 converted to 1.0
   Fail:
   2 + 3 > 2 * 3.
   Error:
   _ > 0.                   (Error 4)
   "s" > 0.                 (Error 5)
