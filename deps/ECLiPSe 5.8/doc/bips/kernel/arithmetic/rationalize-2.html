<H1>rationalize(+Number, ?Result)</H1>
Converts Number into a compact rational number and unifies it with Result.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Number</EM></DT>
<DD>A number.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Result</EM></DT>
<DD>A variable or rational number.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to rationalize(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to
<PRE>
    Result is rationalize(Number)
</PRE>
    which should be preferred.
<P>
   When Number is an integer, Result is a rational with denominator 1.
<P>
   When Number is already a rational, Result is identical to Number.
<P>
   When Number is a float, Result is a rational whose value approximates
   the value of the float to the accuracy of the float representation.
   rationalize/2 usually produces more compact rationals that rational/2.
   Both rationalize/2 and rational/2 produce results that convert back into
   the original float. rational/2 is usually faster than rationalize/2.
<P>
   Bounded reals cannot be converted to rationals.
<P>
   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to
   rationalize/2 is delayed until this variable is instantiated.

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.

Success:
      rationalize(25, 25_1).

      rationalize(3_4,3_4).
      rationalize(9_12,3_4).
      rationalize(-6, Result).      (gives Result = -6_1)
      rationalize(0.1, Result).     (gives Result = 1_10)
