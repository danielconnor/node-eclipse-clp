rational(+Number, ?Result)

   Converts Number into a rational number and unifies it with Result.



Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable or rational number.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to rational(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is rational(Number)

    which should be preferred.

   When Number is an integer, Result is a rational with denominator 1.

   When Number is already a rational, Result is identical to Number.

   When Number is a float, Result is a rational whose value is exactly equal
   to the value of the floating-point number. Since floats are usually
   approximations of the intended value, the results may look unintuitive
   and have unnecessarily large numerators and denominators. Use rationalize/2
   to produce the most compact rational that still converts back into the
   original float. rational/2 is usually faster than rationalize/2.

   Bounded reals cannot be converted to rationals.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to
   rational/2 is delayed until this variable is instantiated.


Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not of type rational.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.
   141 --- Number is a bounded real

      rational(3_4,3_4).
      rational(9_12,3_4).
      rational(-6, Result).      (gives Result = -6_1)
