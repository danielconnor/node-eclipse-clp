<H1>rational(+Number, ?Result)</H1>
Converts Number into a rational number and unifies it with Result.

<DD>A number.

<DT><EM>?Result</EM></DT>
<DD>A variable or rational number.

<H2>Description</H2>
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to rational(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to
<PRE>
    Result is rational(Number)
</PRE>
    which should be preferred.
<P>
   When Number is an integer, Result is a rational with denominator 1.
<P>
   When Number is already a rational, Result is identical to Number.
<P>
   When Number is a float, Result is a rational whose value is exactly equal
   to the value of the floating-point number. Since floats are usually
   approximations of the intended value, the results may look unintuitive
   and have unnecessarily large numerators and denominators. Use rationalize/2
   to produce the most compact rational that still converts back into the
   original float. rational/2 is usually faster than rationalize/2.
<P>
   Bounded reals cannot be converted to rationals.
<P>
   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to
   rational/2 is delayed until this variable is instantiated.

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.

Success:
      rational(25, 25_1).

      rational(3_4,3_4).
      rational(9_12,3_4).
      rational(-6, Result).      (gives Result = -6_1)
      rational(0.1, Result).     (gives Result = 3602879701896397_36028797018963968)
