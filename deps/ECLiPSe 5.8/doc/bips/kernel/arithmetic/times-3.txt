times(?Factor1, ?Factor2, ?Product)

   Succeeds if Product is the result of multiplying integer arguments Factor1
and Factor2.



Arguments
   ?Factor1            An integer or a variable.
   ?Factor2            An integer or a variable.
   ?Product            An integer or a variable.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   Defines the arithmetic relation Factor1 * Factor2 = Product.  If all
   arguments are instantiated times/3 succeeds if this relation holds.  If
   one of the arguments is uninstantiated, it is bound to an integer such
   that the relation holds.  Note that this is not always possible.  If the
   system is in coroutining mode and more than one argument is
   uninstantiated, times/3 delays until at least two of the arguments are
   known.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if it is impossible to find an integer instantiation such that
   Factor1 * Factor2 = Product holds.



Exceptions
     4 --- more than one argument is uninstantiated (non-coroutining    mode only)
     5 --- an argument is neither an integer nor a variable

Examples
   
   Success:
   times(2, 3, 6).
   times(2, 3, Z).                   (gives Z=6)
   times(X, 3, 6).                   (gives X=2)
   times(2, Y, 6).                   (gives Y=3)
   Fail:
   times(3, 4, 5).
   times(3, X, 5).
   Error:
   times(2.0, 3.0, 6.0).             (error 5)
   times(1 + 4, 2, 10).              (error 5)
   times(X, 1, Z).                   (error 4)
