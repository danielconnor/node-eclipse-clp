exp(+Number, ?Result)

   Evaluates the exponential function exp(Number) ("e to the power of Number")
and unifies the resulting value with Result.



Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable, float or breal.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to exp(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is exp(Number)

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to exp/2 is
   delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not a float or breal.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.
    20 --- floating point overflow

Examples
   
Success:
      exp(0.0, Result).       (gives Result = 1.0)
      exp(-6, Result).        (gives Result = 0.00247875)
Fail:
      exp(1, 0.0).
Error:
      exp(A, 6.0).                   (Error 4).
      exp(0, 1).                     (Error 5).
      exp(4 + 2, 403.429).           (Error 24).
      exp(1, r).                     (Error 24).
