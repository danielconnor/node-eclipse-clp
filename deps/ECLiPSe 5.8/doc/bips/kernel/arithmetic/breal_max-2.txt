breal_max(+Number, ?Result)

   Extracts the upper floating point bound of Number

Arguments
   Number              A number.
   Result              A variable or float.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
    This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
    arithmetic expressions.  So a call to breal_max(Number, Result) is
    equivalent to

    Result is breal_max(Number).

    A bounded real is a real number represented by a lower and upper
    bound in floating point format. This predicate extracts the upper
    bound and unifies it with Result. If Number is not a bounded real,
    the result returned is equivalent to converting it to a bounded real
    first.



Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated
     5 --- Number is a not a number.
     5 --- Result is neither a variable nor a float.

Examples
   
Success:
      ?- breal_max(0.99__1.01, X).
      X = 1.01

      ?- breal_max(1, X).
      X = 1.0

      ?- breal_max(1.0, X).
      X = 1.0

      ?- breal_max(1_10, X).
      X = 0.10000000000000002

Error:
      ?- breal_max("a", Z).
      type error in breal_max("a", Z)

      ?- breal_max(2 + 4, Z).
      type error in breal_max(2 + 4, Z)
