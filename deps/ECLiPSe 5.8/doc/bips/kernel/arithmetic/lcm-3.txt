lcm(+Number1, +Number2, ?Result)

   Unifies Results with the Least Common Multiple of Number1 and Number2

Arguments
   +Number1            Integer.
   +Number2            Integer.
   ?Result             A variable or integer.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to lcm(Number1, Number2, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is lcm(Number1, Number2)

    which should be preferred for portability.

   The Least Common Multiple operation is only defined on integer arguments.

   In coroutining mode, if Number1 or Number2 are free variables, the call
   is delayed until these variables are instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Exceptions
     4 --- Number1 or Number2 is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode    only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not an integer.
     5 --- Number1 or Number2 is a number but not an integer.
    24 --- Number1 or Number2 is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      lcm(9, 15, 45).
      lcm(-9, 15, 45).
      lcm(2358352782,97895234896224,X).  ( gives X = 38478583260342225282528 )

Error:
      lcm(A, 2, 6).             (Error 4).
      lcm(1, 2, 3.0).           (Error 5).
      lcm(1.0, 2, 3.0).         (Error 5).
      lcm(4 + 2, 2, 12).        (Error 24).
