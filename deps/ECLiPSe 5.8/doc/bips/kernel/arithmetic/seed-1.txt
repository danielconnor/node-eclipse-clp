seed(+Seed)

   Sets the initial seed Seed for generating random numbers with random/1 or
frandom/1.



Arguments
   +Seed               Integer.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   Used to initialise the seed which is used for the generation of random
   numbers by random/1 or frandom/1.  Setting the same seed value with
   seed/1 enables the generation of a repeatable random sequence with
   random/1 ie.  pseudo-random number generation.

   The seed value should be an integer in the range 1 .. 2^31-1.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Seed is not instantiated.
     5 --- Seed is instantiated, but not to an integer.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: repeat, random(S).
      S = 464880439   More? (;)
      S = 285401533   More? (;)
      yes.
      [eclipse]: seed(1), repeat, random(S).
      S = 2078917053   More? (;)
      S = 143302914   More? (;)
      yes.
      [eclipse]: seed(1), repeat, random(S).
      S = 2078917053   More? (;)
      S = 143302914   More? (;)
      yes.
