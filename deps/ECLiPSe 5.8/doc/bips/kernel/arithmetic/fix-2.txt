fix(+Number, ?Result)

   Unifies the integer part of Number with Result (Truncation towards zero).



Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable or integer.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to fix(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is fix(Number)

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to fix/2 is
   delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not an integer.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      fix(1.5, 1).
      fix(-6.4, -6).
Fail:
      fix(1, 0).
Error:
      fix(A, 6.0).                 (Error 4).
      fix(0.0, 0.0).               (Error 5).
      fix(4 + 2.3, 6).             (Error 24).
      fix(1, r).                   (Error 24).
