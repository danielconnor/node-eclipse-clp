floor(+Number, ?Result)

   Unifies Result with the greatest integral value that is less or equal than
Number and of the same numeric type as Number.



Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable or number.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to floor(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is floor(Number)

   which should be preferred for portability.


   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to floor/2
   is delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result and Number are numbers of different types.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      floor(1.8, 1.0).
      floor(-1.8, -2.0).
      floor(5, 5).
      floor(-6.4, Result).      (gives Result = -7.0)
Fail:
      floor(1.0, 0.0).
Error:
      floor(A, 6.0).                   (Error 4).
      floor(0.5, 0).                   (Error 5).
      floor(1, r).                     (Error 24).
      floor(4 + 2.3, 6.0).             (Error 24).
