+Expr1 =\= +Expr2

   Succeed if the value of Expr1 is not equal to the value of Expr2.



Arguments
   +Expr1              An arithmetic expression
   +Expr2              An arithmetic expression

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   Both arguments are evaluated and their types adjusted.  Then the
   resulting numbers are compared.  The predicate succeeds if the values of
   Expr1 and Expr2 are not equal (beware of rounding errors when comparing
   reals).  If the system is in coroutining mode and the arguments are not
   ground, this predicate delays until the expressions are fully
   instantiated.

   The predicate also delays when the comparison involves bounded reals,
   and the compared values overlap such that the result is undecidable.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      fails if the value of Expr1 is equal to the value of Expr2



Exceptions
     4 --- Expr1 or Expr2 is a variable (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Expr1 or Expr2 is not an arithmetic expression.

Examples
   
Success:
      5 - 1 =\= 6 / 2.
      1 =\= sin(pi/4).      % 1 converted to 1.0

Fail:
      2 + 4 =\= 2 * 3.

Error:
      _ =\= 10.              (Error 4)
      "s" =\= 10.            (Error 5)
