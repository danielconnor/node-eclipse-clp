float(+Number, ?Result)

   Converts Number to float and unifies the resulting value with
Result.



Arguments
   +Number             A number.
   ?Result             A variable or float.

Type
   Arithmetic

Description
   This predicate is used by the ECLiPSe compiler to expand evaluable
   arithmetic expressions.  So the call to float(Number, Result) is
   equivalent to

    Result is float(Number)

    which should be preferred for portability.

   In coroutining mode, if Number is a free variable, the call to float/2
   is delayed until this variable is instantiated.




Resatisfiable
      No

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the result of the evaluation does not unify with Result.



Exceptions
     4 --- Number is not instantiated (non-coroutining mode only).
     5 --- Result is a number but not a float.
    24 --- Number is not of a numeric type.
    24 --- Result is neither a number nor a variable.

Examples
   
Success:
      float(1, 1.0).
      float(-6, Result).         (gives Result = -6.0)
Fail:
      float(1, 0.0).
Error:
      float(A, 6.0).                   (Error 4).
      float(0, 0).                     (Error 5).
      float(4 + 2, 6.0).               (Error 24).
      float(1, r).                     (Error 24).
