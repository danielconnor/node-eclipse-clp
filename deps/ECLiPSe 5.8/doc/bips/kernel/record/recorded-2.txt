recorded(+Key, ?Value)

   Succeeds if the term Value has been recorded in the indexed database under
the key Key.



Arguments
   +Key                An atom or a compound term.
   ?Value              Any Prolog term.

Type
   Recorded Database

Description
   Used to find all values associated with a key.  Unifies Value with the
   first term that has been associated with Key.  In the case of compound
   terms, all keys of the same name and arity are treated as equal.


   Backtracking will unify Value with successive values associated with Key
   in the order in which they were recorded.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the value Value cannot be unified with an associated value of
   the key Key.



Exceptions
     4 --- Key is not instantiated.
     5 --- Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.

Examples
   
   Success:
   [eclipse]: record(beer,paulaner),
   >        record(beer,lowenbrau),
   >        record(beer,spaten),
   >        recorded(beer,Value).
   Value = paulaner     More? (;)
   Value = lowenbrau     More? (;)
   Value = spaten     More? (;)
   no (more) solution.
   Fail:
   erase_all(beer),recorded(beer,guiness).
   Error:
   recorded(Beer,Value).                (Error 4)
   recorded("beer",Value).              (Error 5)
   recorded(1,Value).                   (Error 5)
