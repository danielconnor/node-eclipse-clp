recorda(+Key, ?Value, -DBRef)

   Records the term Value at the beginning of key Key in the indexed database.



Arguments
   +Key                An atom or compound term.
   ?Value              Any prolog term.
   -DBRef              A variable.

Type
   Recorded Database

Description
   Used to record any prolog term Value at the beginning of the indexed
   database entry associated with the key Key.  Unlike recorda/2, this
   predicate delivers a so-called database reference in DBRef which is a
   unique name for the indexed database entry that is created.  Note that
   it is not a number!  In the case of compound terms, all keys of the same
   name and arity are treated as equal.


   If backtracking occurs through the call of recorda/3 the associated
   Value is not removed from the indexed database.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Key is not instantiated.
     5 --- Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.
     5 --- DBRef neither a variable nor a database reference.

Examples
   
   Success:
    [eclipse]: recorda(whiskey,jameson,Ref1),
             recorda(whiskey,bushmills,Ref2).
    Ref1 = 98518
    Ref2 = 98538
    yes.
Error:
    recorda(Key, anything, Ref).          (Error 4)
    recorda("key",anything, Ref).         (Error 5)
    recorda(key,anything, 99).            (Error 5)
