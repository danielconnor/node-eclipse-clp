recorded(+Key, ?Value, -DBRef)

   Succeeds if the term Value has been recorded in the indexed database under
the key Key and DBRef is its unique reference.



Arguments
   +Key                An atom or a compound term.
   ?Value              Any Prolog term.
   -DBRef              A variable.

Type
   Recorded Database

Description
   Used to find all values associated with a key.  Value is unified with
   the first term that is associated with Key.  DBRef is unified with the
   unique database reference of this database entry.  In the case of
   compound terms, all keys of the same name and arity are treated as
   equal.


   Backtracking will unify Value and DBRef with the value resp.  the
   database reference of successive values associated with Key in the order
   in which they were recorded.




Resatisfiable
      Yes.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the value Value cannot be unified with an associated value of
   the key Key.



Exceptions
     4 --- Key is not instantiated.
     5 --- Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.
     5 --- DBRef is neither a variable nor a database reference.

Examples
   
   Success:
   [eclipse]: recordz(beer, paulaner, _),
   recordz(beer, lowenbrau, _),
   recorded(beer, Value, Ref).
   Value = paulaner
   Ref = 98518     More? (;)
   Value = lowenbrau
   Ref = 98538     More? (;)
   no (more) solution.
   Fail:
   erase_all(beer),recorded(beer,guiness, Ref).
   Error:
   recorded(Beer,Value,Ref).            (Error 4)
   recorded("beer",Value,Ref).          (Error 5)
   recorded(1,Value,Ref).               (Error 5)
