<H1>recorded(+Key, ?Value)</H1>
Succeeds if the term Value has been recorded in the indexed database under
the key Key.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Key</EM></DT>
<DD>An atom or a compound term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Value</EM></DT>
<DD>Any Prolog term.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to find all values associated with a key.  Unifies Value with the
   first term that has been associated with Key.  In the case of compound
   terms, all keys of the same name and arity are treated as equal.

<P>
   Backtracking will unify Value with successive values associated with Key
   in the order in which they were recorded.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if the value Value cannot be unified with an associated value of
   the key Key.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   Yes.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Key is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.
