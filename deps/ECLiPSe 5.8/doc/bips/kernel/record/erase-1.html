<H1>erase(+DBRef)</H1>
Succeeds if the database reference DBRef designates a term recorded in the
indexed database and this term is successfully erased.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+DBRef</EM></DT>
<DD>A database reference.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   The database reference DBRef must refer to a term that has been recorded
   in the indexed database.  Database references can be obtained from the
   predicates recorda/3, recordz/3 and recorded/3.  If the referenced term
   has already been erased, erase/1 fails.  Backtracking through calls of
   erase/1 does not undo an erasure.  Note that database references are not
   integers.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if DBRef refers to an already erased record.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>DBRef is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>DBRef is not a database reference.

   Success:
   [eclipse]: recordz(whiskey, jameson, _),
   recordz(whiskey, glenfiddich, Ref),
   recordz(whiskey, dimple, _),
   erase(Ref).
   Ref = 98538
   yes.
   [eclipse]: recorded(whiskey, L, _).
   L = jameson     More? (;)
   L = dimple     More? (;)
   no (more) solution.
   Fail:
   [eclipse]: recorded(whiskey,_,R), !, erase(R), erase(R).
   no (more) solution.
   Error:
