referenced_record(+DBRef, ?Value)

   Succeeds if DBRef is the database reference of a currently recorded term
and this term unifies with Value



Arguments
   +DBRef              A database reference.
   ?Value              Any Prolog term.

Type
   Recorded Database

Description
   The database reference DBRef must refer to a term that has been recorded
   in the indexed database.  Database references can be obtained from the
   predicates recorda/3, recordz/3 and recorded/3.  If the referenced term
   has already been erased, referenced_record/2 fails.  Otherwise, Value is
   unified with a copy of the recorded term.  Note that database references
   are not integers.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the referenced term has already been erased or if it does not
   unify with Value.



Exceptions
     4 --- DBRef is not instantiated.
     5 --- DBRef is neither a variable nor a database reference.

Examples
   
   Success:
   [eclipse]: recordz(beer, paulaner, Ref),
   referenced_record(Ref, X).
   Ref = 1714c8
   X = paulaner
   yes.
   [eclipse]: recorded(beer, _, Ref),
   referenced_record(Ref, X).
   Ref = 1714c8
   X = paulaner     More? (;)
   yes.
   Failure:
   [eclipse]: recorded(beer, _, Ref),
   erase(Ref), referenced_record(Ref, X).
   no (more) solution.
   Error:
   referenced_record(_, Value).         (Error 4)
   referenced_record(123, Value).       (Error 5)
