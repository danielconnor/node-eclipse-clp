<H1>erase(+Key, ?Value)</H1>
Succeeds if the term Value associated with key Key is removed as an entry
in the indexed database.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Key</EM></DT>
<DD>Atom or compound term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Value</EM></DT>
<DD>Any Prolog term.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Finds the first term associated with Key that can be unified with Value
   and removes its entry from the indexed database.  It fails if such an
   entry cannot be found.  If Value is uninstantiated, the first value
   under the key Key is removed.  In the case of compound terms, all keys
   of the same name and arity are treated as equal.  Backtracking through
   calls of erase/2 does not undo an erasure.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Value associated with Key is not a record in the indexed
   database.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Key is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.

   no (more) solution.
   Fail:
