<H1>recorded_list(+Key, ?List)</H1>
Succeeds if the List is the list of all terms that are currently recorded
in the indexed database under the key Key.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Key</EM></DT>
<DD>An atom or a compound term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?List</EM></DT>
<DD>A (possibly empty) list of Prolog terms.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Unifies List with a list of all the terms that are currently recorded
   under the key Key.  While recorded/2 returns the terms one by one on
   backtracking, recorded_list/2  gives them all at once.  The order of the
   list corresponds to the order in which the terms would be delivered by
   recorded/2.  recorded_list/2  could be defined as

<P>
<PRE>
    recorded_list(Key, List) :-
        findall(Term, recorded(Key, Term), List).
</PRE>
   In the case of compound terms, all keys of the same name and arity are
   treated as equal.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails List does not unify with the list of recorded terms.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Key is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>List is neither an variable nor a list.
