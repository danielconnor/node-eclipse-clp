Description
   Used to record any prolog term Value at the end of the indexed database

   of compound terms, all keys of the same name and arity are treated as
   equal.


   If backtracking occurs through the call of recordz/2 the associated
   Value is not removed from the indexed database.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Key is not instantiated.
     5 --- Key is neither an atom nor a compound term.

    [eclipse]: recorded(whiskey,Value).
    Value = jameson     More (;)
    Value = [scotch,irish,canadian,american]     More (;)
    Value = bushmills     More (;)
