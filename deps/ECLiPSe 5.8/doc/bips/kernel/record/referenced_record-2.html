<H1>referenced_record(+DBRef, ?Value)</H1>
Succeeds if DBRef is the database reference of a currently recorded term
and this term unifies with Value


<DL>
<DT><EM>+DBRef</EM></DT>
<DD>A database reference.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Value</EM></DT>
<DD>Any Prolog term.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   The database reference DBRef must refer to a term that has been recorded
   in the indexed database.  Database references can be obtained from the
   predicates recorda/3, recordz/3 and recorded/3.  If the referenced term
   has already been erased, referenced_record/2 fails.  Otherwise, Value is
   unified with a copy of the recorded term.  Note that database references
   are not integers.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if the referenced term has already been erased or if it does not
   unify with Value.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>DBRef is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>DBRef is neither a variable nor a database reference.

<PRE>
   Success:
   [eclipse]: recordz(beer, paulaner, Ref),
   referenced_record(Ref, X).
   Ref = 1714c8
   X = paulaner
   yes.
   [eclipse]: recorded(beer, _, Ref),
   referenced_record(Ref, X).
   Ref = 1714c8
   X = paulaner     More? (;)
   yes.
   Failure:
   [eclipse]: recorded(beer, _, Ref),
   erase(Ref), referenced_record(Ref, X).
   no (more) solution.
   Error:
   referenced_record(_, Value).         (Error 4)
   referenced_record(123, Value).       (Error 5)
