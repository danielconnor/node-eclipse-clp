<H1>functor(?Term, ?Functor, ?Arity)</H1>
Succeeds if the compound term Term has functor Functor and arity Arity or
if Term and Functor are atomic and equal, and Arity is 0.


<DL>
<DT><EM>?Term</EM></DT>
<DD>Prolog term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Functor</EM></DT>
<DD>Atomic term or variable.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Arity</EM></DT>
<DD>Positive integer or variable.

</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   If Term is instantiated, its functor is unified with Functor and its
   arity with Arity.

<P>
   If Term is not instantiated, it is bound to a term with functor Functor
   and arity Arity.

<P>
   This predicate regards atomic terms (number, atom or string) as
   terms with arity 0 and functor equal to the term.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Term does not unify with a compound term with functor Functor
   and arity Arity.  Also fails if Arity is 0 and Functor does not unify
   with Term.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Term and either (or both) of Functor and Arity are    uninstantiated (non-coroutine mode only).
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Arity is neither a variable nor an integer.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Functor is neither a variable nor an atomic term.
<DT><EM>(6) out of range </EM>
<DD>Arity is a negative integer.
