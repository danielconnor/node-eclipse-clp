<H1>copy_term(+OldTerm, ?NewTerm, ?MetaTerms)</H1>
A copy of OldTerm with new variables is created and unified with NewTerm.
MetaTerms is a list mapping the attributed variables in OldTerm to the corresponding
variables in NewTerm.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+OldTerm</EM></DT>
<DD>Prolog term.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?NewTerm</EM></DT>
<DD>Prolog term, normally a variable.
</DD>
<DT><EM>?MetaTerms</EM></DT>
<DD>List of Pairs or a variable.

<H2>Description</H2>
   A copy of OldTerm is created, ie.  a term that is similar to OldTerm but
   the free variables of OldTerm have been replaced by new variables which
   do not occur elsewhere.  In other words, the new term is a most general
   variant of the old one in the sense of variant/2.

<P>
   This predicate is a more primitive version of copy_term/2 and does
   not imply a particular handling of attributed variables. Instead it copies the
   attributed variables as normal variables, and returns the MetaTerms list as
   a means to define the copying of attributed variables separately.  MetaTerms is a
   list of pairs [&lt;attributed variable&gt;|&lt;variable&gt;] which maps the
   attributed variables in OldTerm to the corresponding fresh variables in
   NewTerm.  By processing this list, the variables can be instantiated to
   whatever the user defines as the copy of the attributed variable.

<P>
   Note that copy_term/2 is implemented as

<P>
<PRE>
    copy_term(X, Y) :-
        copy_term(X, Y, Metas),
        apply_copy_term_handlers(Metas).
</PRE>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if NewTerm does not unify with the copy of OldTerm.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
[eclipse 1]: set_flag(output_mode, "QPMV").

yes.
[eclipse 3]: copy_term(s(a,X{a},Y, Z{b}), Copy, Metas).

X = X_m234{a}
Y = Y_g224
Z = Z_m212{b}
Copy = s(a, _g282, Y_g288, _g292)
Metas = [[Z_m212{b}|_g292], [X_m234{a}|_g282]]
yes.
