dim(?Term, ?Dimensions)

   Creates a multi-dimensional array in the form of nested structures,
or computes the dimensions of an existing matrix.



Arguments
   ?Term               Variable or structure.
   ?Dimensions         Variable or list of integers.

Type
   Term Manipulation

Description
    Creates a multi-dimensional array in the form of nested structures,
    or computes the dimensions of an existing matrix.


    When creating an array of dimensions [D1,..,Dn], a nested structure
    is created with the top-level term having the functor []/D1, its
    arguments being structures with functor []/D2, and so on.
    The functor [] is chosen to remind of arrays, but is otherwise
    not significant.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Both Term and Dimensions are not sufficiently instantiated.
     5 --- Dimensions is not a list of integers.

Examples
   
[eclipse]: dim(M,[3,4]), dim(M,L).
M = []([](_131, _132, _133, _134),
       [](_126, _127, _128, _129),
       [](_121, _122, _123, _124))
L = [3, 4]
yes.
