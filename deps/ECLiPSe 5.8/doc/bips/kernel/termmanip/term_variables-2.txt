term_variables(?Term, ?VarList)

   Succeeds if VarList is the list of all variables in Term.



Arguments
   ?Term               Prolog term.
   ?VarList            List or variable.

Type
   Term Manipulation

Description
   This predicate collects all the variables inside Term into the list
   VarList.  Every variable occurs only once in VarList, even if it occurs
   several times in Term.  The order of the variables in the list is not
   specified.  As usual, attributed variables are also considered variables.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     5 --- VarList instantiated but not to a list.

Examples
   
Success:
    term_variables(atom, []).
    term_variables(Term, L).       % gives L = [Term]
    term_variables(f(a,B,c), L).   % gives L = [B]
    term_variables([X,Y,Z], L).    % gives L = [Z,Y,X]
    term_variables([X,Y,X], L).    % gives L = [Y,X]
    term_variables(s(X{a}), L).    % gives L = [X{a}]

Fail:
    term_variables(f(a,B,c), []).
