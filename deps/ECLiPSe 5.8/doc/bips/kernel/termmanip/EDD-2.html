<H1>?Term =..  ?List</H1>
Univ --- Succeeds if List is the list which has Term's functor as its first
element and Term's arguments, if any, as its successive elements.

<H2>Description</H2>
   If Term is atomic and/or List is a single-element list, unifies this
   element with Term.

<P>
   Otherwise, either Term is instantiated to a compound term, or List is
   instantiated to a list, or both.  In which case, ``univ'' unifies Term
   with functor(Arg1, Arg2, ..., ArgN), and List with [Functor', Arg1',
   Arg2', .., argN'], where functor is unified with Functor', Arg1 is
   unified with Arg1', etc.  functor must be an atom, and it must be
   possible to determine the length of List from either Term or List.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if List does not unify with the list corresponding (as above) to
   the prolog term Term.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
