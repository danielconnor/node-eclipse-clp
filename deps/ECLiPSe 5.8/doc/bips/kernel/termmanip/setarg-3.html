<H2>Description</H2>
   Destructively replaces the Nth argument of the compound term Term with
   the term Arg.  The assignment is undone on backtracking.

<P>
   The use of this built-in is strongly discouraged, due to its non-logical
   behaviour!  It is provided only to enable the implementation of certain
   low-level operations that could otherwise not be provided with the same
   efficiency.  Surprising side effects can occur when you don't know
   exactly what you are doing.  In particular, it must be assured by the
   programmer that the old argument value is not needed any longer and that
   the old argument was not aliased to some other location.  The old value
   should also not be a variable.

<P>
   If N is a list of integers and Term is a nested structure, then Arg
   is the subterm of Term described by this list of integers.
   E.g. setarg([2,1,3], Term, Arg) is the same as arg(2, Term, T1),
   arg(1, T1, T2), setarg(3, T2, Arg).

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H3>Exceptions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><EM>(4) instantiation fault </EM>
<DD>Either N or Term (or both) is not instantiated.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>N is instantiated, but not to an integer.
<DT><EM>(5) type error </EM>
<DD>Term is instantiated, but not to a compound term.
<DT><EM>(6) out of range </EM>
<DD>N is an integer less than 1 or greater than the arity of    Term.

<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
      [eclipse]: T = s(a, b, c), setarg(2, T, hello).
      T = s(a, hello, c)
      yes.
      [eclipse]: T = s(a, b, c), ( setarg(2, T, hello) ; true ).
      T = s(a, hello, c)     More? (;)
      T = s(a, b, c)
      yes.
Unpredictable result:
    [eclipse 10]: S=s(A), T=t(A), setarg(1, T, b).
    S = s(A)  or  S = s(b)
    A = b     or  A = A
    T = t(b)
