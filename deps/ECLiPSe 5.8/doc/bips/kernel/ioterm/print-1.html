<H1>print(?Term)</H1>
The term Term is written on the output stream according to the current
operator declarations, using the predicate portray/2 or portray/1 if it
exists.

<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to print the term Term on the current output according to the
   current operator declarations, i.e.  the same as write/1, however the
   user has the possibility to influence the way the term is printed.  If
   the predicate portray/2 is visible in the module where print/1 was
   called from, it is used by print/1 in the following way:

<P>
  * If Term is a variable, it is printed using write/1.

<P>
  * If Term is a nonvariable or an attributed variable, then portray(output,
    Term) is called.  If it succeeds, so does print/1.  Otherwise, if Term is
    atomic, it is written using write/1 and the predicate succeeds.  If
    Term is a compound term, its main functor is printed using write/1 and
    print/1 is called recursively on its arguments.

<P>
   If portray/2 is not visible but portray/1 is, it is called instead of
   portray/2.

<P>
   Note that when this predicate is used to print a list, only the elements
   of the list, i.e.  the heads, are passed to the recursive calls of
   print/1, but not the list tails.

<P>
   portray/1, 2 is used by the system when printing out the answer binding
   in the top-level loop to the answer_output stream and in the debugger,
   when the output command is set to print, to the debug_output stream.

<P>
   As usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed (e.g.
   explicitly using flush/1).

<P>
Note
   The output of print/1 is not necessarily in a form acceptable to
   read/1,2.

<P>
