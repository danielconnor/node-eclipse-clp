portray_term(?Term, -TransTerm, +As)

   Apply portray (write) transformations to Term

Arguments
   Term                A term.
   TransTerm           A variable.
   As                  One of the atoms 'term', 'goal' or 'clause'

Type
   Term I/O

Description
    Applies portray-transformations to Term, if any are visible in the
    caller module. If no transformation is visible, TransTerm is identical
    to Term.
    
    This predicate is intended mainly for testing purposes, because
    portray-transformations are normally performed implicitly by the
    term output predicates write/1,2, writeln/1,2, print/1,2,
    display/1,2, printf/2,3 or write_term/2,3.  


Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   None.

Examples
   
    % Given the program:

	:- local portray(s/1, tr_s/2, []).
	tr_s(0, 0).
	tr_s(s(S), N) :- tr_s(S, N1), N is N1+1.


    % Implicit portray transformation by write/1:
    ?- S = s(s(s(0))), write(S).
    3
    yes.

    % Explicit portray transformation
    % Note: no transformation done by writeq/1
    ?- S = s(s(s(0))), writeq(S), portray_term(S, P, term), writeq(P).
    s(s(s(0)))
    3
    yes.
