read(?Term)

   Succeeds if the next term from the input stream is successfully read and
unified with Term.



Arguments
   ?Term               Prolog term.

Type
   Term I/O

Description
   Used to read the next term from the input stream and unify it with Term.
   The term must be in Prolog term format i.e.  terminated by fullstop (a
   period and a blank space character), neither of which are retained by
   Prolog.


   End of file acts like fullstop.  If only end of file is read, the event
   190 is raised and the default handler unifies Term with the atom
   end_of_file.


   The default action for syntax errors is to print a warning and fail.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
   Fails if a syntax error was detected and no term could be read

Exceptions
   190 --- End of file was encountered before reading any character.
   198 --- Trying to read even after the error 190 was raised.

Examples
      Equivalent to read(input, Term).  (see read/2 for details).
