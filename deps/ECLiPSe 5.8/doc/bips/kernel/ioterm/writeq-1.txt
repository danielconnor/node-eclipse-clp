writeq(?Term)

   The term Term is written on the current output in a form that can be read
in.



Arguments
   ?Term               Prolog term.

Type
   Term I/O

Description

   Used to write the term Term on the current output according to the
   current operator declarations.  Atoms and strings are quoted,
   operator expressions parenthesised (whenever necessary) and the
   (stream-specific or global) print_depth flag is not taken into
   account.  The output of writeq/1 can be read back, provided that
   the same operator declarations are in effect at write and read
   time.  writeq(Term) is equivalent to printf("%QDvw", Term).


   Note that as usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed
   either by closing the stream, by writing again or by using flush/1.


   Note also that although it is possible to print suspensions and external
   handles, these are printed in their printed representation as Prolog
   terms with functors such as 'BAG' (for bag objects). They will be read
   back in as such Prolog terms, rather than as their original type. 




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
      Equivalent to writeq(output, Term).  (see writeq/2 for details).
