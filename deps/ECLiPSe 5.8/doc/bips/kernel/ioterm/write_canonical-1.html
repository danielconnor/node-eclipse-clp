<H1>write_canonical(?Term)</H1>

operator declarations and can be read in.

<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to write the term Term in a form that can be read back independent
   of the current operator declarations.  Atoms and strings are quoted,
   operator declarations are ignored, lists are printed as ./2 structures,
   the (stream-specific or global) print_depth flag is not taken into account,
   variable attributes are printed, and variables are printed with unique
   identifiers.

<P>
   write_canonical(S, Term) is equivalent to printf(S, "%MOQ.vDw", Term).

<P>
   Note that as usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed
   either by closing the output stream, by writing again or by using
   flush/1.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
   Equivalent to write_canonical(output, Term).
   (see write_canonical/2 for details).
