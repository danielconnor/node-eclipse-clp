write(+Stream, ?Term)

   The term Term is written on the output stream Stream according to the
current operator declarations.



Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
   ?Term               Prolog term.

Type
   Term I/O

Description
   Used to write the term Term on the output stream Stream according to the
   current operator declarations.  Lists and compound terms are only
   printed up to the nesting depth specified by the (stream-specific or
   global) print_depth setting (cf. set_stream_property/3, set_flag/2).


   Note that as usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed
   (e.g.  explicitly using flush/1).


Note
   The output of write/1 is not necessarily in a form acceptable to
   read/1,2.




Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is not an atom or an integer.
   192 --- Stream is not an output steam.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.

Examples
   
Success:
      [eclipse]: open(file1,update,s), write(s, X + 2), close(s).
      X = _72
      yes.
      [eclipse]: sh('cat file1').
      _72 + 2
      yes.

Error:
      write(S, a(b,c)).          (Error 4).
      write("string", a(b,c)).   (Error 5).
      write(9, X + 2).           (Error 192). % stream not open
      write(atom, X + 2).        (Error 193).
