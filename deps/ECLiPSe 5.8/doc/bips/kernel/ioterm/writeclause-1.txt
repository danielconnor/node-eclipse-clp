writeclause(+Clause)

   The clause Clause is pretty printed on the current output .



Arguments
   +Clause             A Prolog term.

Type
   Term I/O

Description
   Used to pretty print the clause Clause on the current output according
   to the current operator declarations.


   When reading Prolog clauses from one file, and then writing to the
   current output, the latter part can be done using writeclause/1.  This
   is because the clauses are terminated by a period and a newline, which
   are not retained by Prolog.  writeclause/1 replaces these, and flushes
   the output.


   writeclause/1,2 knows about the special meaning of ,/2, ;/2, ->/2, fg,
   -->/2 and :-/2 and prints the clause with the appropriate indentation of
   subgoals and some (redundant) parentheses to show the clause structure.
   Everything else is written as with writeq/1,2, so output of writeclause/1,2
   is readable for read/1,2.



Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      None.



Examples
   
	Equivalent to writeclause(output, Term).  (see writeclause/2 for details).
