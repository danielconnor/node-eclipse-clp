<H1>print(+Stream, ?Term)</H1>
The term Term is written on the output stream Stream according to the
current operator declarations, using the predicate portray/2 or portray/1
if it exists.

<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to print the term Term on the output stream Stream according to the
   current operator declarations, i.e.  the same as write/2, however the
   user has the possibility to influence the way the term is printed.  If
   the predicate portray/2 is visible in the module where print/2 was
   called from, it is used by print/2 in the following way:

<P>
  * If Term is a variable, it is printed using write/2.

<P>
  * If Term is a nonvariable or an attributed variable, then portray(Stream,
    Term) is called.  If it succeeds, so does print/2.  Otherwise, if Term is
    atomic, it is written using write/2 and the predicate succeeds.  If
    Term is a compound term, its main functor is printed using write/2 and
    print/2 is called recursively on its arguments.

<P>
   Note that when this predicate is used to print a list, only the elements
   of the list, i.e.  the heads, are passed to the recursive calls of
   print/2, but not the list tails.  Thus e.g.  a list [1,2,3] will be
   passed once to portray/2 as a whole and then the elements 1, 2, 3, but
   not [2,3], [3] and [].

<P>
   If portray/2 is not visible but portray/1 is, it is called instead of
   portray/2, but then the Stream argument cannot be passed to it, and it
   is therefore the responsibility of portray/1 itself to print the data to
   the correct stream.  portray/1, 2 is used by the system when printing
   out the answer binding in the top-level loop to the answer_output
   stream) and in the debugger, when the output command is set to print, to
   the debug_output stream.

<P>
   As usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed (e.g.
   explicitly using flush/1).

<P>
Note
   The output of print/2 is not necessarily in a form acceptable to
   read/1,2 and there is no 'printq' predicate.

<P>
