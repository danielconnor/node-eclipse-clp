write_exdr(+Stream, +Term)

   The term Term is written onto the output stream Stream in EXDR-format
(a format for communication with agents in other programming languages).



Arguments
   +Stream             Integer (stream number) or Atom (symbolic stream name).
   +Term               Prolog term.

Type
   Term I/O

Description
    The predicates write_exdr/2 and read_exdr/2 can be used for letting
    ECLiPSe programs exchange data with the host language in an embedded
    environment (e.g.  Java, Tcl).  More generally, they allow exchanging
    data with agents written in programming languages that define a
    mapping from EXDR format to the language's data structures.


    EXDR defines the abstract data types Integer, Double, String, List,
    Nil, Struct and Anonymous Variable. Their mapping to ECLiPSe data
    types is as follows:



        EXDR type       ECLiPSe type        e.g.
        ----------------------------------------------
        Integer         integer             123
        Double          float               12.3
        String          string              "abc"
        List            ./2                 [a,b,c]
        Nil             []/0                []
        Struct          compound or atom    foo(bar,3)
        Anon.Variable   var                 _

    The type of the generated EXDR-term is the type resulting from the
    "natural" mapping of the Eclipse terms.  Atoms are written as
    structures of arity 0 (not as strings).

    Not all ECLiPSe terms have an EXDR representation, e.g. big integers,
    rationals, suspensions or improper lists. The predicate fails in this
    case, nevertheless writing a complete but simplified term to the stream.
    All information about variable sharing and variable attributes in the
    ECLiPSe term is silently lost (no failure).

    Note that as with all output predicates, the output may be buffered,
    so it may be necessary to flush either by closing the stream or by
    using flush/1.

    If the output Stream has the compress-flag set, write_exdr/2 will use a
    more compact variant of EXDR encoding, at the expense of encoding speed.

    More information about EXDR format, including the specification of the
    serialised encoding, can be found in the Embedding and Interfacing Manual.


Resatisfiable
      No.

Fail Conditions
      Fails if the Term cannot be represented in EXDR format.



Exceptions
     4 --- Stream is not instantiated.
     5 --- Stream is not an atom or an integer.
   192 --- Stream is not an output stream.
   193 --- Stream is an illegal stream specification.

Examples
   
Success:
    [eclipse 4]: open(queue(""),update,q),
                 write_exdr(q, foo(12.3,123,["hello",_])),
                 read_exdr(q, Term),
                 close(q).

    Term = foo(12.3, 123, ["hello", _131])
    yes.

Failure:
    write_exdr(q, 617236126172).
    write_exdr(q, 3_4).

Error:
    write_exdr(S, a(b,c)).        (Error 4).
    write_exdr(input, X + 2).     (Error 192).
    write_exdr(atom, X + 2).      (Error 193).
