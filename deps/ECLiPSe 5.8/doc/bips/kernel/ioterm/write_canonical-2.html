<H1>write_canonical(+Stream, ?Term)</H1>
The term Term is written on the output stream Stream in a form that ignores
operator declarations and can be read in.


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Stream</EM></DT>
<DD>Integer (stream number) or Atom (reserved or user-defined                symbolic stream name).
</DD>
<DT><EM>?Term</EM></DT>
<DD>Prolog term.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to write the term Term in a form that can be read back independent
   of the current operator declarations.  Atoms and strings are quoted,
   operator declarations are ignored, lists are printed as ./2 structures,
   the (stream-specific or global) print_depth flag is not taken into account,
   variable attributes are printed, and variables are printed with unique
   identifiers.

<P>
   write_canonical(S, Term) is equivalent to printf(S, "%MOQ.vDw", Term).

<P>
   Note that as usual, the output is buffered, so it may need to be flushed
   either by closing the stream, by writing again or by using flush/1.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
