<H1>writeclause(+Clause)</H1>
The clause Clause is pretty printed on the current output .


<DL>
<DT><EM>+Clause</EM></DT>
<DD>A Prolog term.
</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Description</H2>
   Used to pretty print the clause Clause on the current output according
   to the current operator declarations.

<P>
   When reading Prolog clauses from one file, and then writing to the
   current output, the latter part can be done using writeclause/1.  This
   is because the clauses are terminated by a period and a newline, which
   are not retained by Prolog.  writeclause/1 replaces these, and flushes
   the output.

<P>
   writeclause/1,2 knows about the special meaning of ,/2, ;/2, -&gt;/2, fg,
   --&gt;/2 and :-/2 and prints the clause with the appropriate indentation of
   subgoals and some (redundant) parentheses to show the clause structure.
   Everything else is written as with writeq/1,2, so output of writeclause/1,2
   is readable for read/1,2.
<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   None.


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
