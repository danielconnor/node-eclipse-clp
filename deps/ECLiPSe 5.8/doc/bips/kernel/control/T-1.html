<H1>~?Goal</H1>
The sound negation operator.  If Goal is not ground, the predicate delays.


<DL>
<DT><EM>?Goal</EM></DT>
<DD>Callable term or a variable.

<H2>Description</H2>

   This is the sound negation operator.  It can be used instead of
   not/1, or \+/1 (the negation as failure operators).  It is known
   that negation as failure may yield non-logical results if the Goal
   contains free variables.  To avoid this, ~/1 delays if Goal is not
   ground.  If the free variables are bound later in the execution,
   the delayed predicate is woken and executed and may yield success
   or failure.  While ~/1 always behaves logically, in some cases it
   delays where negation as failure or constructive negation would
   have immediately (and correctly) failed.

<P>

<H3>Fail Conditions</H3>
   Fails if Goal can be satisfied


<H3>Resatisfiable</H3>
   No.
<H2>Examples</H2>
<PRE>
Success:
    ~ 3 = 4.
    ~ 3 = X,            (delays ...
        X = 4.             ... and succeeds with X = 4)
Fail:
    ~ 3 = 3.
    ~ 3 = X,            (delays ...
        X = 3.             ... and fails)
    ~ X = X,            (delays ...
        X = 3.             ... and fails)
