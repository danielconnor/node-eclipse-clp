det_insert_from_corresponding_lists(+Map0, ++KeyList, ?ValueList, -Map)

   Insert key/value pairs into a map, aborting if any of the keys already exist.

Arguments
   Map0                A map
   KeyList             A list of keys to insert
   ValueList           A list of values corresponding to the keys in KeyList
   Map                 The map after insertion

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	This predicate takes a map Map0, and for each key Key in KeyList
	and corresponding value Value from ValueList, calls
	det_insert/4 to insert the Key/Value pair into the map.
	The result after all the insertions is the map Map.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if the lists aren't the same length.
