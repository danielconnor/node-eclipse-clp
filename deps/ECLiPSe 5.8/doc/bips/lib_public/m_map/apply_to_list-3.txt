   Map a list of keys to their corresponding values.

Arguments
   KeyList             A list of keys to map
   Map                 The map to apply
   ValueList           The list of corresponding values

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	This predicate applies the map Map to a list of keys KeyList to
	produce the list of values ValueList; i.e. it maps a list of keys
	to their corresponding values.  If one of the keys in KeyList is
	not found in Map, then the predicate aborts witha runtime error.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if ValueList does not unify with the list of values corresponding to KeyList.
