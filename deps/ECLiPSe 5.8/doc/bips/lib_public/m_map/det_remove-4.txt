det_remove(+Map0, ++Key, ?Value, -Map)

   Remove a key/value pair from a map, aborting if the key is not present.

Arguments
   Map0                A map
   Key                 The key to remove
   Value               The value corresponding to Key
   Map                 The map after removal

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	This predicate removes the key Key and its corresponding value from
	the map Map0, resulting in the map Map.  It then attempts to
	unify the removed value with Value.  If the key Key was not in the
	map Map0, then the predicate aborts with a runtime error.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Value does not unify with the value corresponding to Key.
