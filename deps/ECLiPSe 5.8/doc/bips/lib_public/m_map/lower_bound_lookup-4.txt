lower_bound_lookup(+Map, ++SearchKey, ?Key, ?Value)

   Search a map for the smallest key no smaller than SearchKey.

Arguments
   Map                 A map
   SearchKey           A key to search for
   Key                 The key found
   Value               The value corresponding to Key

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	This predicate searches the map Map for the entry with the
	smallest key which is no smaller than SearchKey.  If such a key is
	found, then it attempts to unify it with Key and the corresponding
	value with Value.  If such a key is not found, then it aborts with
	a runtime error.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Key and Value do not unify with the key and value found.
