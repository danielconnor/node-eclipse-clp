det_update(+Map0, ++Key, ?Value, -Map)

   Update the value corresponding to a key in a map, aborting if it doesn't exist.

Arguments

   Map                 The map after updating

Type

Description
	
	If the key Key already exists in the map Map0, then this
	predicate updates the corresponding value to be Value, resulting
	in the map Map.  If the key Key is not already in the map,
