Description
	
	The map Map is the result of merging the map MapA and the map MapB;
	i.e. Map contains all the key/value pairs from both MapA and MapB.
	If MapA and MapB have a key in common, then it is not defined
	which corresponding value will end up associated with that key
	in Map.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
