optimize(+Map0, -Map)

   Optimize a map for many lookups but few/no modification.

Arguments
   Map0                A map to optimize
   Map                 The optimized map

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	Declaratively, this predicate does nothing (i.e. the map Map is
	equivalent to the map Map0).  However, operationally it suggests to
	the implementation that the representation of the map be optimised
	for lookups, with few or no modifications to be expected.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Never fails.
