   Search a map for a value.

Arguments
   Map                 A map
   Value               A value to search for
   Key                 A key corresponding to Value

Type
   library(m_map)

Description
	
	This predicate searches the map Map for value entries which unify
	with Value.  If such a value is found, then it attempts to unify the
	corresponding key with Key.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with maps created by other
	predicates from the map module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   yes

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Value does not appear in Map or if Key does not unify with any corresponding keys found.
