lib(m_tree234)

	
	This module implements 2-3-4 trees.  They can be used to manage and
	index a collection of key/value pairs.  You probably want to use the
	interface provided by `map.pl' instead of using this module
	directly.
	
	
	Note that keys must be ground, but values are allowed to be
	variables.
