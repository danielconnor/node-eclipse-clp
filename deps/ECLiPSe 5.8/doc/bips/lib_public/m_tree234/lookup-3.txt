Description
	
	This predicate searches the tree Tree for an entry with key Key.

	value with Value.  If the key is not found, then it aborts with
	a runtime error.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with trees created by other
	predicates from the tree234 module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
