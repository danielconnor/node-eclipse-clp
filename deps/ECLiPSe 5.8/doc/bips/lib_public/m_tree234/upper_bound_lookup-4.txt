upper_bound_lookup(+Tree, ++SearchKey, ?Key, ?Value)

   Search a tree for the largest key no larger than SearchKey.

Arguments
   Tree                A 2-3-4 tree
   SearchKey           A key to search for
   Key                 The key found
   Value               The value corresponding to Key

Type
   library(m_tree234)

Description
	
	This predicate searches the tree Tree for the entry with the
	largest key which is no larger than SearchKey.  If such a key is
	found, then it attempts to unify it with Key and the corresponding
	value with Value.  If such a key is not found, then it aborts with
	a runtime error.
	
	
	This predicate should only be called with trees created by other
	predicates from the tree234 module.
	
	

Resatisfiable
   no

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Key and Value do not unify with the key and value found.
