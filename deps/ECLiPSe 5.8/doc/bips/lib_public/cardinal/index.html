<H2>Description</H2>
Cardinal is a sets constraints library with especial inferences
	on sets cardinality and other optional set functions (minimum and maximum for
	sets of integers, and union for sets of sets.)
	<P>
	A set is naturally used to collect distinct elements sharing some property.
	Combinatorial search problems over these data structures can thus be naturally
	modelled by high level languages with set abstraction facilities, and efficiently
	solved if constraint reasoning prunes search space when the sets are not fully
	known a priori (i.e. they are variables ranging over a set domain).
	<P>
	Many complex relations between sets can be expressed with constraints such as set
	inclusion, disjointness and equality over set expressions that may include such
	operators as intersection, union or difference of sets. Also, as it is often the
	case, one is not interested simply on these relations but on some attribute or
	function of one or more sets (e.g. the cardinality of a set). For instance, the
	goal of many problems is to maximise or minimise the cardinality of a set. Even
	for satisfaction problems, some sets, although still variables, may be constrained
	to a fixed cardinality or a stricter cardinality domain than just the one inferred
	by the domain of a set variable (for instance, the cardinality of a set may have
	to be restricted to be an even number).
	<P>
	Cardinal represents set variables by set intervals with a lower and an upper bound
	considering set inclusion as a partial ordering. Consistency techniques are then
	applied to set constraints by interval reasoning. A set domain variable S may be
	specified by an interval [A,B] where A and B are known sets ordered by set inclusion,
	representing the greatest lower bound and the lowest upper bound of S, respectively.
	<P>
	The cardinality of a set S, given as a finite domain variable C (#S=C), is not a
	bijective function since two distinct sets may have the same cardinality. Still,
	it can be constrained by the cardinalities of the set bounds.
	<P>
	A simple inference that can be done using cardinality information is to instantiate
	the set to one of the set bounds, when it is known that the set cardinality must be
	equal to the cardinality of that bound. But Cardinal does much more than that.
	For instance, consider two set variables
	S1,S2, that can assume either set value {} (empty set) or {a,b}. Their set domain
	is thus [{},{a,b}] with cardinality 0 or 2. The intersection of S1 and S2 also
	yelds set domain [{},{a,b}]. But we need a special inference to conclude that the
	intersection cardinality is also either 0 or 2 (it can not be 1). Set solvers
	other than Cardinal do not make such inferences.
	<P>
	Inferences using cardinalities can be very useful to deduce more rapidly the
	non-satisfiability of a set of constraints, thus improving efficiency of
	combinatorial search problem solving. As another simple example, if Z is known to be
	the set difference between Y and X, both contained in set {a,b,c,d}, and it is known
	that X has exactly 2 elements, it should be inferred that the cardinality of Z can
	never exceed 2 elements (i.e. from X,Y in {a,b,c,d}, #X=2, Z=Y\X it should be
	inferred that #Z =< 2). A failure could thus be immediately detected upon the
	posting of a constraint such as #Z=3.
	<P>
	Inference capabilities such as these are particularly important when solving set
	problems where cardinality plays a special role. Cardinal thus fully uses
	constraint propagation on sets cardinality.
	<P>

<B>Intervals and Lattices</B>
	<P>
	Set intervals define a lattice of sets. The set inclusion relation between two
	sets defines a partial order on P(U), the powerset over a certain universe U,
	the set of all subsets of U.
	<P>
	Due to the transitivity rule, the top set, U, includes all sets of P(U);
	while the bottom set, {}, is included in all sets of P(U). Consequently,
	sets U and {} constitute an upper bound and a lower bound of P(U), respectively.
	In addition, they are the least upper bound (lub) or join, and the greatest lower
	bound (glb) or meet of P(U), since there is no other upper bound contained in
	(‘less’ than) U  nor other lower bound containing (‘greater’ than) the empty set {}.
	<P>
	Let us now consider for U={a,b,c,d}, the sub-lattice connecting {a,b,d} and {b}
	(thus also including sets {a,b} and {b,d}). Sets {} and {a,b,c,d} are still a
	lower and an upper bound, but this time the glb is {b} and the lub is {a,b,d}.
	<P>
	The two bounds (glb and lub) define a set interval (e.g. [{b},{a,b,d}]) and may
	form the domain of a set variable S, meaning that set S is one of those defined
	by its interval (lattice); all other sets outside this domain are excluded from
	the solution. Thus, b is definitely an element of S, while a and d are the only
	other possible elements.
	<P>
	Set interval reasoning allows us to apply consistency techniques such as Bounded
	Arc Consistency, due to the monotonic property of set inclusion.
	<P>
	Any set variable must then have a domain consisting of a set interval. In addition,
	this interval should be kept as small as possible, in order to discard all sets
	that are known not to belong to the solution, while not loosing any of the still
	possible values (sets). The smallest such domain is the one with equal glb and lub,
	i.e. a domain of the form [B,B], corresponding to a constant set B. For a set
	variable that can assume any set value from a collection of known sets, such as
	{{a,b},{a,c},{d}}, the corresponding interval is the convex closure of such
	collection (which in this case is the set interval [{},{a,b,c,d}]). In general,
	for n possible arbitrary sets S1...Sn, the corresponding set variable X has an
	interval domain [glb, lub] where glb is the intersection of all S1...Sn, and lub
	is their union.
	<P>
<B>Implementation Notes</B>
	<P>
	In Cardinal, all sets are represented as sorted lists, which eases working with
	sets and lists interchangeably.
	<P>
	Set variable bounds are represented by its glb and its lub\glb, the set of
	additional possible elements, which we refer to as poss.
	<P>
	Cardinal implements a number of set constraints such as inclusion, equality,
	inequality, membership, disjointness, and even complement, together with set
	operations (union, intersection and difference), as built-in.
	<P>
	As mentioned, Cardinal also allows the definition and use of optional set functions
	(other than cardinality): minimum and maximum, for sets of integers, and union,
	for sets of sets. Refer to the available predicates for details.
