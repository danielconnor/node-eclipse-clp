?SetVariable `:: ?Domain

   Set variable declaration

Arguments
   SetVariable         A variable.
   Domain              A set domain with optional cardinality declaration.

Type
   library(cardinal)

Description
Declare or constrain a set domain variable to have Domain as domain.
		Domain may assume 3 forms: Glb..Lub, Glb+Poss or Glb+Poss:Cardinality.
		Glb is a ground set denoting the SetVariable's glb. Lub is a ground set
		denoting the SetVariable's lub. Poss is a ground set denoting the SetVariable's
		poss (lub\glb). Cardinality is the SetVariable's cardinality, which may be
		an integer, an FD variable, or an integer domain (list or range).

Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   Fails if SetVariable can not be constrained accordingly.

Examples
   
?- S `:: []..[a,b].
?- S `:: []+[a,b].
?- S `:: []+[a,b]:1.
?- S `:: [x]+[a,b]:C.
?- S `:: []+[a,b]:[0,2].
?- S `:: [c]+[a,b,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k]:[2,4..7].
