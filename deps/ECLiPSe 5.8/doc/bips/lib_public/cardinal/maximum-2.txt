maximum(?SetVariable, ?Max)

   Maximum of a set of integers

Arguments
   SetVariable         A Set (variable or ground) of integers.
   Max                 An integer or an FD variable.

Type
   library(cardinal)

Description
Max is the maximum (i.e. the highest element) of SetVariable.
		If Max is given (as an integer or FD variable) then SetVariable is
		constrained to have such maximum.
		If Max is a free variable, then it is unified with the set's maximum as
		an FD variable or an integer (if it is already known).
		maximum/2 can thus be used either to declare (or constrain) a maximum
		function or to retrieve it.

Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Max can not be the maximum of SetVariable.

Examples
   
?- S`::[]..[1,2], maximum(S,M).
?- set(S,[],[1,2],[maximum:2], maximum(S,M).
M = 2

?- S`::[]+[1,2], maximum(S,1).
S = [1]

?- set(S,[],[1,2],[maximum:1], maximum(S,M).
S = [1]
M = 1
