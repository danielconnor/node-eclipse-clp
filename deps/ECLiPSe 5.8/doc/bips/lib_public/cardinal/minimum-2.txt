minimum(?SetVariable, ?Min)

   Minimum of a set of integers

Arguments
   SetVariable         A Set (variable or ground) of integers.
   Min                 An integer or an FD variable.

Type
   library(cardinal)

Description
Min is the minimum (i.e. the lowest element) of SetVariable.
		If Min is given (as an integer or FD variable) then SetVariable is
		constrained to have such minimum.
		If Min is a free variable, then it is unified with the set's minimum as
		an FD variable or an integer (if it is already known).
		minimum/2 can thus be used either to declare (or constrain) a minimum
		function or to retrieve it.

Resatisfiable
   No.

Fail Conditions
   Fails if Min can not be the minimum of SetVariable.

Examples
   
?- S`::[]..[1,2], minimum(S,M).
?- set(S,[],[1,2],[minimum:1], minimum(S,M).
M = 1

?- S`::[]+[1,2], minimum(S,2).
S = [2]

?- set(S,[],[1,2],[minimum:2], minimum(S,M).
S = [2]
M = 2
