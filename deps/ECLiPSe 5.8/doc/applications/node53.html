Testing</A>
</H1>
Testing<A NAME="1018"></A> is often one of the activities that gets dropped when delivery time points get closer. This is a sad mistake, as any problem that is not recognized immediately will take much more effort to find and correct later on. In an ideal world, tests for each component are defined before implementation and cover each level of the design. In the real world we must find the right compromise between spending time on defining tests in the beginning and time spent on developing the application core.

<P>
A test may have different objectives:

<UL><LI>The weakest form is a test that is run to check if a program works with the test data, i.e. produces some answer without generating an error. We have suggested this form of test above to check an (incomplete) early implementation. 

<LI>A more complex test can be used to exercise all (or nearly all) of the program code. The test data must contain enough variation to force all alternative parts in the program. This can be achieved either by accumulating large number of tests or by designing particular tests to handle special cases.

<LI>Another test form is <I>regression</I><A NAME="1021"></A> testing. This form of testing is used to evaluate results of a program run after each modification of the code. Results of previous runs are used to check the current results. This does not check for correctness, but rather for the same answer before and after a change.

<LI><I>Correctness</I><A NAME="1023"></A> of a program can only be checked if we have obtained the expected results of a test in an independent way, either by hand or by a trusted program, or simply by re-using benchmark sets from a third party.

<LI>We may also be using some tests to do <I>performance testing</I><A NAME="1025"></A>, i.e. to check that the program finds the solution within given limits on execution time and/or system resources. Clearly, this only makes sense if we also check the result for correctness. 

</UL>

<P>
It is important to realize the limitations of the tests that we perform. If we have never checked that the solutions produced by a regression test are correct, then they will be most likely <I>not</I> correct. We only know that they are still the same solutions that the program has found before.

<P>
Unfortunately, testing of combinatorial problem<A NAME="1028"></A> solvers is even more complex than testing of ``normal'' programs. Often, a given problem has more than one solution, and it is not clear in which order the answers will be produced. Providing one solution may not be enough, but there may be millions of solutions in total.
