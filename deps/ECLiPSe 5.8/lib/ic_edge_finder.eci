:- comment(desc, "\n    This library implements the quadratic edge-finder algorithm for the\n    disjunctive and cumulative scheduling constraints for the IC solver.\n    It provides stronger propagation than the ic_cumulative library, but\n    weaker than the cubic ic_edge_finder3 library for cumulative\n    constraints.  It is however computationally cheaper than the\n    ic_edge_finder3 library.\n\n    Note that the same predicates are implemented in both ic_edge_finder\n    and ic_edge_finder3 libraries.\n").
