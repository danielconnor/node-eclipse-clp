Summary of function
===================

Display the source of a selected predicate.

Layout
======

This tool consists of:

Source window: the source of the selected predicate is shown here, the
  source is obtained from the file in which the predicate is defined.

Refresh button: rereads the source file and redisplays the predicate. 

Close button: closes the window


Functionality
=============

A predicate can be selected from the predicate properties window or from
the tracer tool. If show source is selected, then Tkeclipse tries to read 
the file in which the predicate is defined, and attempts to find the
predicate and displays it. It may not be able to do so because the
predicate is not available in source form, or because tkeclipse was unable
to locate it in the source file. 

Refresh button
--------------

A predicate source can be changed because it has been edited since the
source was displayed. Such changes are not automatically reflected in the
source window, and the refresh button re-reads the source file to redisplay
the predicate source.
